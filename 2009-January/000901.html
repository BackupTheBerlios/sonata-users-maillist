</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at first: great software, thanks. I used Sonata for some month now an I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really like it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope this feature request has not been discussed before, I skimmed the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> archives of 2008 and didn't find anything like that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's about sorting: When I sort by Artists, the songs are sorted by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their file names, which may be reasonable, but my whole library is named
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like &quot;artist - album - track number - title&quot;, which sorts the tracks by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their numbers. I want to sort them by song titles, though.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Johannes,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Artist sorting actually sorts by Artist-&gt;Album-&gt;Disc-&gt;Track. If you have
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of albums in your playlist, it's a pretty sensible default. But I do
</I>&gt;<i> notice now that there isn't any way to sort by song title (unless you have a
</I>&gt;<i> column that starts with song title, then you can click on the column name).
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps I should add it, it'd be pretty simple to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Sounds nice, this would be great. :)

&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So what about retaining the previous order when resorting by clicking on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the columns headings? That's how it is implemented for example in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Foobar2000, the client I use on Windows , and in other music players as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm afraid I don't understand the connection between this suggestion and
</I>&gt;<i> your previous paragraph - how would the reverting the sort by clicking on
</I>&gt;<i> the column headers help you sort by song titles? I also don't understand how
</I>&gt;<i> it fits in with the current sonata behavior where the column headers sort
</I>&gt;<i> the column by either ascending or descending. I find that to be pretty
</I>&gt;<i> intuitive. I have heard suggestions about allowing a third click on the
</I>&gt;<i> column header to perform your 'revert' action - but that's much less simple
</I>&gt;<i> to code than the current behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm struggling a little to understand. Can you clarify?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
when I thought about it, it was just like 'uhm, there are no column
headers at all... Could there be...?', so I quickly checked the
preferences and found that nice '|' stuff for creating column headers.
And now I could just click on 'Track' -&gt; sorts by track and after that
on 'Artists' -&gt; sorts by artist, retaining the alphabetical order of the
songs. :( I'm sorry for stealing your time, this completely solves my
feature request, it was just... I never noticed there was a way to
activate column headers. -.- *embarrassed*

Makes Sonata even greater for me stupid noob! :)

Thanks.

Johannes
