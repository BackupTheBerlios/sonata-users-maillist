I'm sorry, I must have broken it while I was making other changes, as it 
was broken for many other languages as well. I cleaned the code a bit 
more and now it works in my tests again - please let me know whether it 
works for you too.

&gt;<i> Filtering lists in other GTK programs works here too (rhythmbox
</I>&gt;<i> and the gtk file selection dialog)
</I>
There's an additional issue of whether the first character displays 
correctly in all cases, but I don't know if it's important enough in 
some languages to fix it. For example, if I press &lt;Compose&gt; a &quot; I expect 
to see &#228; as the first character, but get two characters a and &quot; instead. 
I should have a look at how the GTK file selection dialog implements this...

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't even know what kind of input methods are used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for typing Arabic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Me neither, unfortunately. I am relatively a noob.
</I>
I'm sorry again. I meant to ask if you sometimes need to press several 
keys on the keyboard to type a character, and if there is some user 
interface element on the screen while typing in addition to the text 
box. For example, in Chinese, you need to type what the character sounds 
like and then choose from a list of possibilities.

Tuukka
