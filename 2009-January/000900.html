Hi Johannes,

The Artist sorting actually sorts by Artist-&gt;Album-&gt;Disc-&gt;Track. If you have
a lot of albums in your playlist, it's a pretty sensible default. But I do
notice now that there isn't any way to sort by song title (unless you have a
column that starts with song title, then you can click on the column name).
Perhaps I should add it, it'd be pretty simple to do.


&gt;<i> So what about retaining the previous order when resorting by clicking on
</I>&gt;<i> the columns headings? That's how it is implemented for example in
</I>&gt;<i> Foobar2000, the client I use on Windows , and in other music players as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>

I'm afraid I don't understand the connection between this suggestion and
your previous paragraph - how would the reverting the sort by clicking on
the column headers help you sort by song titles? I also don't understand how
it fits in with the current sonata behavior where the column headers sort
the column by either ascending or descending. I find that to be pretty
intuitive. I have heard suggestions about allowing a third click on the
column header to perform your 'revert' action - but that's much less simple
to code than the current behavior.

Anyway, I'm struggling a little to understand. Can you clarify?

Scott
