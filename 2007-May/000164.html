<PRE>I just noticed that some of my that files aren't completely tagged and
Sonata would simply just search for covers matching the artist name
and pick the first one found. The problem is that there doesn't seem
to be anyway to tell Sonata that the cover is wrong and should be
deleted. Manually deleting it isn't an option as it will be fetched
again the next time it's played.

I also think I noticed one or two covers fetched were pure wrong even
though the song was properly tagged and manually searching revealed
the correct cover isn't available. This would obvious be amazons
search engine who is at fault, but again there is no way to say &quot;no,
this is the wrong cover, don't display any cover instead of the wrong
one&quot;.

Thus, I would like to request some way of preventing the wrong cover
from being shown. Saving a copy of the no-cover-available image as
Artist-Album in ~/.covers/ is one way of solving it, but not a very
good one. Perhaps having some internal database over albums being
marked for not having their covers remotely fetched?
