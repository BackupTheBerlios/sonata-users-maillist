I guess this was never a concern to my since all of my music files do
have track numbers in their filenames. Generally speaking, I think
it's a good idea - but it would be needed to be implemented in such a
fashion so that it works smartly. In other words, if the user selects
multiple albums or a hodge-podge of misc music files, it needs to
order the tracks only within each album as opposed to across all the
albums/files.

Actually, I just had some second thoughts about this.. In fact, in the
Artist and Album views, music files are sorted by track numbers and
this sorting is preserved if tracks are added to the current playlist.
If these two views didn't exist, I'd agree that sorting tracks might
be the right thing to do for the Filesystem view, but since they do
exist, I'm tempted to say the Filesystem view should remain as it's
currently implemented, reflecting the user's exact filesystem
structure.

P.S. You could always write a simple bash script to add track numbers
to all your files if you have them at least organized well :p
