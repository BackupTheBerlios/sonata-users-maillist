&gt;<i> Hello. I installed Sonata recently and I really like it, however, what keeps
</I>&gt;<i> me from using it as a permanent fixture on my system is the way tracks in
</I>&gt;<i> the library are handled. Some people, like myself, put their entire library
</I>&gt;<i> of music, as one playlist, and let mpd just shuffle through the whole thing
</I>&gt;<i> all the day long. In fact, i've never  used any other playlist in mpd :)
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, in Sonata, if you try to find a song through  the Library
</I>&gt;<i> view,  and you double click it, it adds the song to the end of the current
</I>&gt;<i> playlist. This functionality is good if people use small playlists of a
</I>&gt;<i> single album or something, but for those of us who have  our entire music
</I>&gt;<i> collection as the playlist, this behavior is very inconvenient.  Since my
</I>&gt;<i> entire collection of music is my  playlist, the library view is an ideal way
</I>&gt;<i> to choose a particular song  from my playlist, since scrolling through the
</I>&gt;<i> entire playlist is slow and clunky (several thousand songs). I still use the
</I>&gt;<i> ncurses mpd client called ncmpc, because it is the only one i've found,
</I>&gt;<i> where, if you select a song in the library view, that is already on the
</I>&gt;<i> playlist, it selects that song on  the playlist, instead of adding it again
</I>&gt;<i> to the end of the playlist.  I would really like to see some kind of option
</I>&gt;<i> in Sonata, where you could change the default behavior, and tell  it to play
</I>&gt;<i> the song in the playlist i f it's already on the playlist, and to add the
</I>&gt;<i> song to the playlist if it is not. Thanks :)

I think the recently implemented song filter in svn might be what
you're looking for. It will allow you to quickly find a song in your
playlist and play it.
