<PRE>Hello. I installed Sonata recently and I really like it, however, what keeps
me from using it as a permanent fixture on my system is the way tracks in
the library are handled. Some people, like myself, put their entire library
of music, as one playlist, and let mpd just shuffle through the whole thing
all the day long. In fact, i've never  used any other playlist in mpd :)
Unfortunately, in Sonata, if you try to find a song through  the Library
view,  and you double click it, it adds the song to the end of the current
playlist. This functionality is good if people use small playlists of a
single album or something, but for those of us who have  our entire music
collection as the playlist, this behavior is very inconvenient.  Since my
entire collection of music is my  playlist, the library view is an ideal way
to choose a particular song  from my playlist, since scrolling through the
entire playlist is slow and clunky (several thousand songs). I still use the
ncurses mpd client called ncmpc, because it is the only one i've found,
where, if you select a song in the library view, that is already on the
playlist, it selects that song on  the playlist, instead of adding it again
to the end of the playlist.  I would really like to see some kind of option
in Sonata, where you could change the default behavior, and tell  it to play
the song in the playlist i f it's already on the playlist, and to add the
song to the playlist if it is not. Thanks :)
