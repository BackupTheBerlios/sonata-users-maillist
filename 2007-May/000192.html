<PRE>Hello,

Agreed, but here is why I did not notice that Artist and Album views
sort music files by track order : it seems that when tags are updated
outside of Sonata, they are not taken into account even after a good
old &quot;mpc update&quot; ; however, if I rename the files at the same time
I fix their tags, mpc update is enough to get the new tags
into Sonata.

Here is the testcase I used. Let's say I've copy to my mpd library
this tree structure from a backup CD-R created a loooong time ago,
without any tags set because the tools I used back in 1998 did not
know about them :

The Doors
   Waiting for the sun
       The Doors - Five To One.mp3
       The Doors - Hello, I Love You.mp3
       The Doors - Love Street.mp3
       etc.

1. I set the correct tags on these files with Easytag, without any
   renaming, just to test this.
2. I run &quot;mpc update&quot; and wait for the update to finish.
=&gt;
    - The library view (Artist, Album) does *not* reflect the
      new tags.
    - The &quot;Edit tags&quot; window, however, knows about the new tags.
3. I rename these files with Easytag and get files such as 
   The Doors - Waiting for the sun - 01 - Hello, I Love You.mp3, 
   etc.
4. I run &quot;mpc update&quot; and wait for the update to finish.
=&gt; All good, all Sonata views reflect the new tags.

&gt;<i> P.S. You could always write a simple bash script to add track numbers
</I>&gt;<i> to all your files if you have them at least organized well :p
</I>
Sure, I could.

Ciao,
