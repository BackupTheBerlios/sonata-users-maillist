<PRE>Hello all,

I'd like to report these as bugs. Three things:

1: When sonata searches for covers it uses a weblink and adds the artist 
and album names. It usually works for me, unless there are special 
characters in the names. For instance I have an album by the artist 
Herbert Gr&#246;nemeyer, it's called &quot;Luxus&quot;. The initial cover search 
didn't come up with any results. After I edited the search terms to 
search for &quot;Herbert Groenemeyer&quot; instead it worked. 

I think nowadays you can use special characters in URL's but they have 
to be encoded somehow. On the other hand maybe the URL doesn't support 
this and conversions like &quot;&#246;&quot; -&gt; &quot;oe&quot; are necessary. Any thoughts about 
this issue?

2. When the covers are saved to ~/.covers the charset of the filename 
gets messed up. Instead of

Herbert Gr&#246;nemeyer-Luxus.jpg

I get

Herbert Gr&#195;&#182;nemeyer-Luxus.jpg

It looks like the filename charset used is UTF8, allthough my charsets 
are all set to ISO-8859-15.

My locale settings are fine btw. The other apps I use treat special 
chars in filenames just fine.

3. My Vorbis Various Artists albums are tagged like this:

User comments section follows...
        ARTIST=2Pac &amp; Snoop Dogg
        TITLE=2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted
        ALBUM=Live At The House Of Blues Soundtrack
        DATE=2005
        TRACKNUMBER=25
        GENRE=Rap

So the artist changes throughout the album. Problem is Sonata can't find 
the covers anymore, because there's no album by the artist &quot;Pac &amp; Snoop 
Dogg&quot; called &quot;Live At The House Of Blues Soundtrac&quot;. Amazon doesn't 
like the artist &quot;Various Artists&quot; either. Finally &quot;2Pac&quot; turned up the 
proper result. If it was the search term I could easily live with that, 
but because the artist changes with every track I'd have to search the 
image every time it does. Is there some way for Sonata to check for 
Various Artists albums and treat their cover names differently?

I know this isn't pressing, to most people this is even irrelevant 
because they don't own music with special chars. Anyway, any input is 
appreciated.

Thanks
Sebastian
