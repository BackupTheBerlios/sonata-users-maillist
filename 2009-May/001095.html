Isn't Ctrl-A a fairly ubiquitous &quot;select all&quot; action? Honestly, I
thought it was surprising that I didn't need to select all my songs in
the current tab to save them to a playlist.

I don't use playlists much either, which may be due to the awkwardness
of making playlists in Sonata. In the end the patch will only be a
bandage for bigger issues. Having a nasty popup in my face when I want
to append songs to a list is just plain mean.

What if we have a menu like so?

&quot;Save selected to&quot; &gt;
                    &quot;New&quot;
                    --------
                    &quot;Append&quot; &gt;
                               &quot;My list 1&quot;
                               &quot;My list 2&quot;
                    &quot;Replace&quot; &gt;
                               &quot;My list 1&quot;
                               &quot;My list 2&quot;

This way, I can simply right click, select the append option, which
shows me my list of playlists, and choose the list I want to append to.
The same scenario can occur if I want to replace a list. The benefit is
I don't have to deal with a modal dialog.

We might also want to add this sort of option to the library tab.
Building a misc playlist is especially cumbersome as you have to add a
song to the current tab, go to the current tab and select the song, then
add it to your playlist. Cutting out the current tab would be a huge win.

&gt;<i>  Stephen, are you working on this still?
</I>
Not now. I'm just holding onto the patch that was sent.
