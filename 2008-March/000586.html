Hy Jason,
actually if it says  &quot;Fetching lyrics failed&quot; it is definitely trying to
fetch lyrics, so all settings should be correct. There shouldn't be any
ports to forward either.
The most common reason for this error in the past has been that either
the connection timed out (slow response from LyricWiki (that is what
sonata uses for lyrics), but it's pretty fast for me right now) or
LyricWiki was down temporary.
If it still doesn't work now it is probably a time-out (slow internet
connection?).  Try setting self.LYRIC_TIMEOUT to something higher than
10 in line 166 in sonata/main.py (I (and I think sonatas SVN too) used
100 when LyricWiki was still very slow).
If that doesn't help try the following:
In 2998 of sonata/main.py there is a except-clause. It will hide any
errors that happen during lyric fetching and put &quot;Fetching lyrics
failed&quot; instead.
Add a line after that and put &quot;raise&quot; there.
Start sonata from a terminal, try to fetch some lyrics and tell us what
error is shown in the terminal.

I hope some of that helps.
