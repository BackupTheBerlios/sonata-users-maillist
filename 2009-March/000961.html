<PRE>Hello everybody,
thanks for bringing Sonata so far :-) .. I really do like the job you
did. Today I met some people who have never seen Sonata before and
watching them use it gave me some ideas about new features.

1. Add a menu entry or an entry in the preference dialog to change
default on left mouse doble click in library tab. Currently it adds
selected song(s) to current playlist. It would be nice to be able to
assign it to replace the entries as well, because some people expect
(or prefer) this behaviour.

2. Allow spaces in interactive library search writing &quot;antonio molina&quot;
would give all cases matching &quot;antonio&quot; and &quot;molina&quot; - the same way it
works while searching current playlist. People not knowing Sonata get
confused when the search results disapear after hiting the space.

3. Change the two dots in Filesystem view to up arrow? or back arrow?
and &quot;/&quot; to &quot;Music collection&quot;? People were confused and did not know
how to go back one level while using the library (not everybody is
familiar with the notation used in Linux/UNIX).

4. Add a shortcut key that would select all the results given then
type-searching the library.. (now I am typing to search, want to
select all, type Ctrl-A and only gets selected what I typed - works as
expected, but it would be nice to be able to select all the results
directly via Ctrl-Shift-A for example)

5. Is there a way to disable moving tabs with the mouse? I have seen
people to move them accidentally and having difficulty to find where
they were then..


Some of the ideas I see more important and some less, but I think they
would help to clarify things for people who are not tecnically
oriented and who have never used Sonata before.

Thanks a lot for your work again..

P.S.
Yes, I am writing this after a night long party using Sonata as a
media player by various people with various state of souberness... but
why could not Sonata be easier to use in this way as well?? :-)
