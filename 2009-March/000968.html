</I>
There's some precedent for this sort of mouse-click customization. The Tab Mix Plus extension for Firefox has a library of click events, and you can assign them to the left-, middle-, and right- buttons to suit your preference. It's a nice way of allowing people to tune the app behavior to their personal taste, or even cultural convention, since that comes into play sometimes with keyboard layout and such.

 2. Allow spaces in interactive library search writing &quot;antonio molina&quot;
&gt;<i> would give all cases matching &quot;antonio&quot; and &quot;molina&quot; - the same way it

</I>&gt;<i> I'll test this when I get home, but if I'm understanding your description correctly, it should work this way in Sonata 1.6. Can you be more explicit about exactly what you are seeing as you type and what you're expecting to see?
</I>
I'm sort of confused about the way that the search function works in the Library tab. Just starting to type in the Current list filters results that contain the typed string -- and that makes sense. But it's not going to give individual results for &quot;antonio&quot; and &quot;molina&quot; if you type &quot;antonio molina&quot;, only that string as a complete entity.

In the Library tab, typing only jumps to the first hit from the first character, and moves on sequentially from there. So if I hit &quot;s&quot;, I don't get everything with an &quot;s&quot;, I jump to the first hit that BEGINS with &quot;s&quot;, and the next character I type better match something in the esses, or the search is done. It would be really nice if search in the Library tab worked like it does in the Current. I think this is what Tomas is asking for, but I'm confused by Scott's answer. Is Sonata already supposed to behave like this?

3. Change the two dots in Filesystem view to up arrow? or back arrow?
&gt;<i> and &quot;/&quot; to &quot;Music collection&quot;? People were confused and did not know
</I>&gt;<i> how to go back one level while using the library (not everybody is
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with the notation used in Linux/UNIX).&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me think some about this.
</I>
That's not a Linux/UNIX nomenclature, it's an old school GUI file system convention that you used to see on pretty much all platforms. The original Windows file manager did this, and some apps like WinRAR still use it. I hope that if there's a change, it won't completely eliminate this functionality. It's a nice way of keeping the Sonata UI clean.

Tomas does bring up a valid point, though. If you've never seen a GUI look like this, what is obvious to some people will be completely obtuse for others. A possible solution might simply be to write in slightly ghosted text &quot;root&quot; and &quot;up&quot; (or whatever labels people agree make the most sense) beside the &quot;/&quot; and &quot;..&quot;.

4. Add a shortcut key that would select all the results given then
&gt;<i> type-searching the library.. (now I am typing to search, want to
</I>&gt;<i> select all, type Ctrl-A and only gets selected what I typed - works as
</I>&gt;<i> expected, but it would be nice to be able to select all the results
</I>&gt;<i> directly via Ctrl-Shift-A for example)&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a good idea and certainly doable. I already listen for some keypresses (up, down, pg up, pg dn) to perform special actions, I can do the same for ctrl-A.
</I>
That would certainly be a cool feature.
