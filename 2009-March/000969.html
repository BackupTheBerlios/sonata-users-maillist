You're confusing the built-in gtk find-as-you-type (if a gtk treeview has
focus and you start typing, it matches like you described above) with the
library searching that is performed when you type in the search entry below
the treeview. I assume Tomas was referring to the latter.

For the current tab, we override the built-in gtk find-as-you-type to
provide a more functional filtering capability. Indeed this could be done
for the library tab as well, but it isn't currently. I'd be worried about
the two capabilities conflicting and being confusing to the user, but I
agree it's already an imperfect state.

I recently had this conversation with someone (I thought it was you?). In
any case, that's where we stand.
