Just starting to type in the Current list filters results that contain the typed string -- and that makes sense. But it's not going to give individual results for &quot;antonio&quot; and &quot;molina&quot; if you type &quot;antonio molina&quot;, only that string as a complete entity.

</I>&gt;<i> In the Library tab, typing only jumps to the first hit from the first character, and moves on sequentially from there. So if I hit &quot;s&quot;, I don't get everything with an &quot;s&quot;, I jump to the first hit that BEGINS with &quot;s&quot;, and the next character I type better match something in the esses, or the search is done. It would be really nice if search in the Library tab worked like it does in the Current. I think this is what Tomas is asking for, but I'm confused by Scott's answer. Is Sonata already supposed to behave like this?&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> You're confusing the built-in gtk find-as-you-type (if a gtk treeview has focus and you start typing, it matches like you described above) with the library searching that is performed when you type in the search entry below the treeview. I assume Tomas was referring to the latter.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For the current tab, we override the built-in gtk find-as-you-type to provide a more functional filtering capability. Indeed this could be done for the library tab as well, but it isn't currently. I'd be worried about the two capabilities conflicting and being confusing to the user, but I agree it's already an imperfect state.

</I>&gt;<i> I recently had this conversation with someone (I thought it was you?). In any case, that's where we stand.

It was me, in response to my suggestion that the search function should be the same on both tabs. Thought I'd chime in here and see if I couldn't learn something about the way Sonata does its thing.

I see now what you were saying in response to Tomas' question. The search results do behave fine with spaces. However, I don't understand the logic behind the way that Sonata returns results. Using the search entry box, no matter what you search for, you get files as a result. And I guess that's where my thinking goes all pear shaped. If I use the gtk find-as-you-type feature, I can (clumsily) search for an artist/album (because I keep my directory structure organized that way). But if I use the Album selector and the search box -- which does a nice fuzzy search -- I get a blizzard of individual files as a result. They're not organized in a way that I can sort, and in order to make any sense of what I'm looking at, I have to hover each result. (The tooltip is quite handy in this regard.)

I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining, it just doesn't compute in my head. If I search for albums, I expect a list of matching albums as a result. Not the contents thereof.

(As a kind of side note, if you get files as the result of a search, it would be a cool feature to be able to add the entire album that a file comes from to the playlist. You can do something similar from the different view dropdowns now, as default behavior of the view. But it would be cool to be able to do it from search results.)

I thought Tomas was onto something similar with his initial question. But I see now, I was misinterpreting said question. Thanks for clarifying.
