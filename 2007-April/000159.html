&gt;<i> Okay, I implemented the logic for Various Artists that I think should

$ svn up
At revision 392.

Trying to use a local image as cover for a various artists album
(happens when clicking Open in the dialog):

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;~/Saker/sonata/sonata-svn/sonata.py&quot;, line 3878, in
choose_image_local_response
    if os.path.exists(dest_filename):
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.5/posixpath.py&quot;, line 171, in exists
    st = os.stat(path)
TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, NoneType found

Image was saved as /tmp/cover.jpg

Trying to use a remote image seems to work, except the image isn't
saved. I can see it in ~/.covers/tmp/ so it looks like it isn't moved.
Manually moving it to ~/.covers/Various Artists-Album.jpg made it show
up though.
