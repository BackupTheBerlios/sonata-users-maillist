<PRE>Okay, I implemented the logic for Various Artists that I think should
satisfy 99% of situations. It's all automated, which I greatly prefer
to any sort of manual flagging. Now, if you have a VA album (defined
by Sonata as &gt;3 artists with the same album name as the current song),
you should be able to set the artwork for one song and it will show
for the rest of the songs. As before, it will also show up as a VA
album in the info window.

Once again, any testing is greatly appreciated. It's very possible
that I introduced a regression or bug while doing this, although it's
been stable so far here (granted I had lots of bugs whilst getting to
this point ;-)).

Scott

P.S. If the user's preference is storing artwork in ~/.covers, the
artwork will be saved as &quot;~/.covers/Various Artists-AlbumName&quot;.
