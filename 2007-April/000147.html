<PRE>Hi Sebastian,

In the future, please send these kinds of emails to the sonata-users
list instead of my email address so that others can chime in with
ideas/suggestions/comments.

On 4/25/07, Sebastian Kemper &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sonata-users">sebastian_ml at gmx.net</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> Hello Scott,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for Sonata! I was looking for a program to fill in for ncmpc and
</I>&gt;<i> I think I found what I was looking for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, let me get some stuff off my chest:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - can't get song infos when right clicking a song. Right clicking on a
</I>&gt;<i> tab shows the info for the currently playing song only.
</I>
This was a conscious decision, see
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/sonata-users/2007-January/000063.html.">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/sonata-users/2007-January/000063.html.</A>
All of the feedback I got (most of it was a direct email response to
me, for some reason) preferred the current implementation.

&gt;<i> - Strings containing Ellipsis' (...) miss a space IMHO, see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis</A>
</I>
The ellipsis is a gtk+ thing, I have no control over it (except to say
that I want strings ellipsized at the end, not the beginning or
middle). File a bug report with them.

&gt;<i> - there's no way to see what program the systray icon belongs to; it
</I>&gt;<i> sounds kind of stupid but I'd like some hint that this is Sonata
</I>&gt;<i> running when I hover over the icon
</I>
Can you suggest a particular hint?

&gt;<i> - is the &quot;Show player&quot; action in the right click menu of the systray
</I>&gt;<i> icon necessary?
</I>
Of course not. But does it hurt to have it? FWIW, it's consistent with
gaim/pidgin's systray right-click menu.

&gt;<i> - can you include a volume picture? I take it Sonata looks for an
</I>&gt;<i> already installed icon. I'm a KDE user and until I installed sonata I
</I>&gt;<i> didn't even have gtk+ and now I'm missing this icon, presumably a Gnome
</I>&gt;<i> icon (see attached png)
</I>
I don't believe I can do anything about this, unfortunately. Either I
hardcode in all of the volume icons, which means it won't follow
users' gtk themes, or I do the current approach where it shows a
broken image for people with themes that don't have the icon. It
sucks, but the gtk.Image.set_from_file() call documented at
<A HREF="http://pygtk.org/docs/pygtk/class-gtkimage.html#method-gtkimage--set-from-file">http://pygtk.org/docs/pygtk/class-gtkimage.html#method-gtkimage--set-from-file</A>
says:
'If the file isn't found or can't be loaded, the resulting gtk.Image
will display a &quot;broken image&quot; icon.' - there doesn't seem to be any
way to detect if this was the case to fallback on an included icon,
unless I am missing something. If anyone can prove me wrong, please do
chime in, I'd love to fix this.

&gt;<i> - mnemonics (Alt-{}) are displayed on right click menus but they don't
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>
The right-click menu is a pop-up menu, not a persistent menu in the
application. It works as every other application works. Besides, you
can use the same mnemonic for two menu items but you can't have the
same shortcut for two items.

&gt;<i> - there's a little confusion in the format settings: It says &quot;{} - Info
</I>&gt;<i> displayed only if all enclosed tags are defined&quot; but in the examples
</I>&gt;<i> above you seem to use []
</I>
Are you referring to &quot;[Sonata]&quot;? This isn't an example of the &quot;{}&quot;, it
literally shows up in brackets in the titlebar.

&gt;<i> - Maybe you want to add a trailing &quot;/&quot; to the website URL
</I>
Can do.

I have snipped your translation related comments for a private email.

Scott
