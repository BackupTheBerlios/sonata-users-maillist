Once again, it looks like the problem is with Amazon. If you look at
the &quot;Known Issues&quot; for the latest version of Amazon's web services
[1], you'll see:

&quot;Default input content encoding is not UTF-8.  -  JP is the only
locale that correctly takes UTF8 input. All other locales use LATIN1.
-  Do not use applications dependent on UTF8.&quot;

Interestingly enough, I found the previous Amazon bug that caused
sonata to stop fetching artwork as well:

&quot;GZIP functionality not working.  -  XML responses are not GZIP'ed,
even if the proper Accept-Encoding header is sent with the request.  -
 Do not use requests that stipulate a GZIP'ed response.&quot;

I can't believe they still haven't fixed the latter after all these
months. And the former seems like an awfully big issue too. Ah well,
not much I can do about it.

&gt;<i> Now I really have a feeling my mind is playing tricks on me. I could
</I>&gt;<i> have sworn I tried the equivalent of those lines and it worked. I also
</I>&gt;<i> could have sworn that I have gotten correct lyrics within sonata in the
</I>&gt;<i> past (that was a longer time ago though).
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://lyricwiki.org/LyricWiki:SOAP">http://lyricwiki.org/LyricWiki:SOAP</A> seems to suggest that getting lyrics
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't work at all using SOAPpy (or at least that's how I understand
</I>&gt;<i> it)... very interesting.
</I>
Perhaps that comment is old and is fixed with a more recent SOAPpy. As
to your mind playing tricks, it's always possible that it was working
correctly on LyricWiki's end at one point ;-)
