<PRE>Hi folks,

Sonata's not dead yet and a few courageous people are still hacking a
bit on it.
It's my pleasure to announce a new pre-release of Sonata 1.7a1: as the
version number indicates, this is still an alpha, for those brave enough
to give it a try!

Due to the numerous cleaning and refactoring to improve the readibility
and simplify Sonata, this is mostly a developer release, but feel free to
try it out nevertheless!

Grab it while it's fresh at <A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata/">https://github.com/multani/sonata/</A>


So, what do we have here?

&gt;<i>From Python 2/GTK 2 to Python 3/GTK 3
</I>-------------------------------------

The major change is definitively the port to Python 3 and Gtk 3: this is
a great news for developers since this is a quite hard work to drop soon
to-be-dead technologies but is has to be done one day, and they can now
profit from a cleaner base. Python 2 is going to be phased out soon
(some distributions already plan to ship only Python 3), Gtk 2 is is not
going to receive anymore improvement in the future, as well as the Python
binding to Gtk 2.
As a consequence, Sonata now depends on PyGObject instead of PyGTK.
PyGObject is still in constant development, and Sonata already discover
some bugs in the binding. As a consequence, it is recommended, although
not mandatory, to use the latest version of PyGObject (3.7.4 and above
are known to work quite well). Earlier versions, such as 3.4.x shipped
in most distributions *should* work in most cases.

For end users, it doesn't change lot of things though: dependencies have
changed and they are probably still a few bugs hidden here and there due
to the port... If you don't feel like a tester, I would recommend to
stay with Sonata 1.6.x, but bug reports are more than welcome!

Those changes themselves are enough to justify a new release, but there
are a few things more!

Other goodies
-------------

Beside the Py3/Gtk3 port, this have been improved:

  * lyrics and covers should work again
  * better support for newer MPD releases
  * better support for fullscreen mode
  * slightly improved UI


&gt;<i>From Sonata 1.6.x to Sonata 1.7a1
</I>---------------------------------

Using the new version requires updating the list of depencendies:

  * you don't the following anymore:
    - Python 2
    - PyGTK
    - python-eggtrayicon

  * .. but you will need the following:
    - Python 3
    - PyGObject
    - python-mpd2

Things currently planned for Sonata 1.7
---------------------------------------

* Restore the tagging plugin (there's no release yet with Python 3
  support, although upstream already integrated our fixes).
* Replace the current notification system to use the desktop
  notifications instead. Hopefully, we'll still be able to propose the
  old system as an alternative.
* startup performance improvements
* a &quot;favorites songs&quot; system
* probably other things, want to get involved? :)

Where to I get this already?
----------------------------

The code can be find in the Git repository at
<A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata">https://github.com/multani/sonata</A> or you can grab a tarball at the
following address:
<A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata/archive/v1.7a1.tar.gz">https://github.com/multani/sonata/archive/v1.7a1.tar.gz</A>

Bugs should be preferably reported on Github at
<A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata/issues">https://github.com/multani/sonata/issues</A> or here on the mailing-list.

If you have patches which add new features, improve Sonata or fix bugs,
you can submit them as pull requests on Github at
<A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata/pulls">https://github.com/multani/sonata/pulls</A> or here on the mailing list.

Final word
----------

Hopefully, this is going to shake Sonata a bit and revive this great
player.

Thanks for those who waited here, thanks for those who are going to try
this new release, and special thanks to all the people who helped to
make this new release out!

 Jonathan
