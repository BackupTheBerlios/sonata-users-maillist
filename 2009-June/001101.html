There is still some trust here to make sure the authors place the
decorator, but really who cares? We will maintain most of the plugins in
our tree so we won't really have a problem.

&gt;<i> Here's a nifty thought -- fresh off the presses in my mind, so I

</I>&gt;<i> that particular callback is called, it gets passed this object. Hmm,
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about this a bit more, I think this might also have too much
</I>&gt;<i> overhead. Something to come back to, definitely.
</I>
It sounds interesting, but I'm not sure either. More importantly, there
isn't a real &quot;core&quot; to Sonata so far. The base class is a mash of code
which we're slowly picking away at.

&gt;<i>  Attributes might be a bit cleaner, but would be more difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> handle when missing (i.e. as opposed to plugin.get('key','default')).
</I>
Well, missing attributes can be defaulted with getattr(plugin, 'key',
'default') - so not too tricky.

&gt;<i> Sorry, I was starting to ramble. I tend not to think out what all I
</I>&gt;<i> want to say in advance, and it just kind of comes as I type. I think I
</I>&gt;<i> was trying to hammer home two disparate ideas here: first, that each
</I>&gt;<i> plugin -- if contained within it's own module -- could be imported
</I>&gt;<i> directly, from anywhere -- e.g. 'from SuperAwesomeGuysPluginPack
</I>&gt;<i> import WickedCoolPlugin'. This is less of a concern, but it avoids
</I>&gt;<i> having to bring in and parse the module manually if you could just do
</I>&gt;<i> a simple import statement.
</I>
Ok, thanks for clarifying that. Makes sense to me and it's definitely an
advantage of leveraging the language. Of course, finding
SuperAwesomeGuysPluginPack is a bit tricky right?

&gt;<i> Good discussion so far. I think any patches from my end will be quite
</I>&gt;<i> far away -- I'll be doing my work primarily locally and in Bazaar
</I>&gt;<i> branches on Launchpad (<A HREF="http://www.launchpad.net/~scott-armitage">http://www.launchpad.net/~scott-armitage</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.launchpad.net/%7Escott-armitage">http://www.launchpad.net/%7Escott-armitage</A>&gt;), but I think there's a
</I>&gt;<i> lot more to hash out first, especially if I'm going to try tackling a
</I>&gt;<i> plugin revamp.
</I>
Great. I look forward to seeing something come out of this discussion.
There is definitely a lot more to figure out, but it doesn't mean you
can't hack away at something first and figure out where the next
roadblock is :-) At the least, I've started thinking more critically
about this.

&gt;<i> Thank you kindly for the input; I presume that Tuukka is subscribed to
</I>&gt;<i> this list, so I'll not bother him(?) about it just yet, but certainly
</I>&gt;<i> as I start getting a clearer picture of where I see this heading.
</I>
Yes he is.
