Do you guys have a lot of experience with plug-in systems, or would you 
just need more documentation to understand my design before going 
further? I admit I've never implemented a plug-in system before, I just 
know some: Eclipse, Firefox, Compiz, MoinMoin... Manuel Naranjo took the 
first stab at the plug-in system, and I designed the current one based 
on that.

The requirements that lead to the magic stuff:
  * We want plug-in metadata.
  * We want a simple plug-in to be a single file.
  * If a plug-in isn't enabled, we want its code to have no effect.

I'm open to new designs if someone comes up with something better 
(import plug-ins in a sandbox, anyone?).

&gt;<i> This one is a toughy. Too many callbacks and you're wasting CPU cycles 
</I>&gt;<i> calling the hook notification functions (and any plugin callbacks that 
</I>&gt;<i> get called as a result). Too few, and you lose the ability for plugins 
</I>&gt;<i> to get in on the action.
</I>
I wouldn't worry too much about CPU cycles: it's not like we're working 
on signal processing here. It's more about having an appropriate model 
of the domain.

Requirements:
* We want simple things to be simple and complex things to be possible.
* If MPD changes or Sonata changes, the plug-in interface should remain 
backward-compatible (within reason).

&gt;<i> Allowing plugins to have access to the Sonata base class certainly gives 
</I>&gt;<i> them access to any information they may want to take advantage of, but 
</I>&gt;<i> it also gives them too much power over the core. I was briefly 
</I>&gt;<i> considering -- though I do not think this is a good way to go -- of 
</I>&gt;<i> implementing a ReadOnlyBase class, which effectively would have a 
</I>&gt;<i> reference to the main class instance, and then provide read-only 
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces to all of the attributes. Too much overhead, I think -- there 
</I>&gt;<i> must be a simpler way to access this.
</I>
Too tight coupling would be the real problem here. I'd want to see a 
solution based on a domain model of properties (and objects?) including 
observers -- more concretely: pretty much what gobject properties and 
signals are (but I think we should unsubscribe a plug-in automatically 
when it gets disabled).

&gt;<i> each plugin 
</I>&gt;<i> -- if contained within it's own module -- could be imported directly, 
</I>&gt;<i> from anywhere -- e.g. 'from SuperAwesomeGuysPluginPack import 
</I>&gt;<i> WickedCoolPlugin'. This is less of a concern, but it avoids having to 
</I>&gt;<i> bring in and parse the module manually if you could just do a simple 
</I>&gt;<i> import statement.
</I>
Concretely:
  * How do you locate plug-in packages?
  * How do you enumerate plug-ins?
  * How do you import the code?

One answer to this is in sonata/pluginsystem.py: lines 11-15, lines 
145-158, lines 180-185 respectively. Again, I'm open to improvements.

&gt;<i> Second, the part you already got -- in Python, a function that does some 
</I>&gt;<i> action on a particular type of object should be able to perform the 
</I>&gt;<i> comperable action on any object type that it is reasonable to apply it 
</I>&gt;<i> to -- in particular, any subclasses of a class must only /extend/ a 
</I>&gt;<i> superclass. But this starts to become less about typing and more about a 
</I>&gt;<i> specification if you take away the focus on OO programming (which indeed 
</I>&gt;<i> may be overkill here -- I'm not sure one needs  room for /instances/ of 
</I>&gt;<i> plugins so much...).
</I>
What you describe is generic to subtyping. Python style prefers duck 
typing specifically, which means you don't require the objects of a type 
  to actually be instances of a (sub-)class. The requirement follows:
  * We want that plug-ins don't have to extend a sonata.Plugin class.

&gt;<i> I was kind of flip-flopping back and forth between the idea of a 
</I>&gt;<i> plugin being a module vs. a plugin being an object instance/class. I 
</I>&gt;<i> have a bad tendency to jump straight to OO fundamentals without fully 
</I>&gt;<i> thinking through the applicability, even though I usually end up with a 
</I>&gt;<i> functional/OO hybrid solution to stuff. But you're right, certainly a 
</I>&gt;<i> module/class with specified attributes would work just as well as a 
</I>&gt;<i> dictionary. I suppose either way, as long as you have a specification 
</I>&gt;<i> indicating what needs to be provided and in what form, either one would 
</I>&gt;<i> work. Attributes might be a bit cleaner, but would be more difficult to 
</I>&gt;<i> handle when missing (i.e. as opposed to plugin.get('key','default')). 
</I>
Currently, a plug-in is a module with the required metadata magic. The 
capabilities of a plug-in are currently described in the metadata to 
meet a requirement:
  * We may want to know the capabilities of a plug-in to decide when to 
load it.

The Python name that implements a capability is included in the 
metadata. This distances the names from the interface: allows a plug-in 
to have multiple implementations of a capability, allows a single name 
to implement multiple capabilities, allows a plug-in to implement 
capabilities in (multiple) objects etc. Something comparable would be to 
have the plug-in modules call sonata.register_plugin at import and pass 
a mapping from capabilities to implementations. This seems to me to be 
additional boilerplate with little advantage, although it felt more 
natural for internal plug-ins (see e.g. sonata/amazoncovers.py lines 
15-19). The decorator *syntax* might help here.

There is some exploration of the current system being used in the OO 
style plus commentary by the developer here:
<A HREF="http://github.com/github076986099/sonata-plugins/tree/master">http://github.com/github076986099/sonata-plugins/tree/master</A>

As can be seen here, the life cycle model needs to be designed 
carefully. Python modules are loaded but never unloaded, so we need 
something like the current &quot;enablables&quot; capability for setup and 
teardown (if it should be possible to disable plug-ins at runtime). The 
capability can instantiate classes, and other capabilities can refer to 
methods in the resulting objects (sonata/pluginsystem.py line 81).

&gt;<i>     These are just my thoughts. If you have patches I can review it might
</I>&gt;<i>     be easier to understand what you want to do.
</I>
Yes, creating a working patch is one good way to ensure the scope of the 
solution is complete as well as detailed.

&gt;<i>     If you want to rework the plugin framework, I think it might be easier
</I>&gt;<i>     to start fresh from the latest release. At least there you can easily
</I>&gt;<i>     rip out (or ignore) the existing framework. Nowadays, some of the core
</I>&gt;<i>     functionality (artwork, lyrics) has been moved into plugins, so
</I>&gt;<i>     working from the trunk might be harder. Of course, that functionality
</I>&gt;<i>     isn't essential, so it's probably ok either way.
</I>
Just remember that the trunk has some necessary clean-ups applied to it 
as well. My bet would be that it's easier to understand the current 
system and refactor it to your liking.

Tuukka
