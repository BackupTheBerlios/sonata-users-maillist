<PRE>I've been doing a bit more thinking on this (in the two measly hours since
my first posting). This is just me jotting down a few ideas I've had while
looking at the plugin system.

First, I'm not a huge fan of this &quot;plugin magic&quot; section. Sonata is Python,
plugins are Python -- why not just do the magic in Python? Sonata core could
have a generic Plugin class that specifies a basic API (with most functions
being &quot;pass&quot;), as well as code to do plugin validation. People writing
plugins would write a module with a new plugin class that inherits from
Plugin (i.e. `class NotifyPlugin(sonata.Plugin):` or some-such).

You could have a fixed-name for the enablables (which needs a new name, by
the way) function/method that all plugins must provide. For registering
callbacks (i.e. hook notifications), you could just have a dictionary keyed
on hook-name, with the values being the method callables. (Alternatively,
you could have the plugin register it's callbacks with the pluginsystem
module in Sonata.. but I like the idea of Sonata core doing the work
instead. Then you just need to provide this dictionary, and the rest will be
handled by itself).

Each plugin module would also have a dictionary with all the plugin info,
i.e. license, author, name, description, etc.; whether or not there should
be a &quot;Configure&quot; button in the plugins window (a la Firefox), and so on.

This method allows the pluginsystem to simply locate plugin modules, load
the information for the window, and then -- if enabled -- instatiate an
instance of the plugin. In true Pythonic fashion, any plugin shall act
exactly as a Plugin object would -- that is, the rest of Sonata can treat
them all the same, with no special code based on what they plugin wants to
do, etc. This avoids having to parse plugin files for the configure info
(let Python do the heavy lifting), and also allows pre-compiled plugin
modules for faster importing.

I would appreciate any feedback on these ideas.

Regards,
-Scott

&gt;<i> Hi all, long-time-listener, first-time-caller (except a few bugs back in

</I>&gt;<i> About a week ago, I ran into an issue where I was trying to interact with

</I>&gt;<i> interact with. I was slightly frustrated by this, and then I started

</I>&gt;<i> So, I started hacking away at 1.6.2 and quickly came up with something that

</I>&gt;<i> notification using `pynotify` (if the user had checked an additional box in
</I>&gt;<i> preferences). Worked great!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I started looking at how the code could be merged with the current SVN
</I>&gt;<i> version, and that's when I found Leo Iannacone's `notify.py` plugin, and in
</I>&gt;<i> fact the plugin system in general (I hadn't known this was coming down the
</I>&gt;<i> pipe). Basically, my reason for calling is this: I have some ideas to
</I>&gt;<i> enhance the notify plugin, however this requires a bit more flexibility in
</I>&gt;<i> the plugin system. From what I can see in the code, it seems like the only
</I>&gt;<i> plugin callback currently implemented is for `playing_song_observers`; is
</I>&gt;<i> this correct? I'm going to start working on adding some extra hooks to the
</I>&gt;<i> Sonata core to allow plugins to operate at a more general level.
