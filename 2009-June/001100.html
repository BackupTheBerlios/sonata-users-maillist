Glad to  see we're on the same page here =P

I was thinking that maybe a decorator pattern would work for
&gt;<i> callbacks. I'm not sure though, and I haven't thought that through too
</I>&gt;<i> carefully. I guess the decorator would be registering the callback
</I>&gt;<i> with the core, which you don't like :-)
</I>

Actually the decorator pattern kind of subverts my issue with registering
the callback with the core; mainly, that trusting the plugin author to take
of that each and every time would be tedious and could introduce errors. If
a decorator pattern took care of all that automatically, then you achieve
the same thing I was thinking of -- mainly, having a single code-base that
handles the linking.

Also, what kind of callbacks should be provided? Maybe song change,
&gt;<i> time change, tags change, play, stop, etc. Do we allow plugins to
</I>&gt;<i> affect the core, or do we sandbox them? If we allow plugins to change
</I>&gt;<i> the state we may get caught in infinite callback loops. If we have
</I>&gt;<i> competing artwork plugins, maybe an amazon artwork vs. a last.fm
</I>&gt;<i> artwork plugin, how do we make sure only one is enabled? As you can
</I>&gt;<i> see there are a lot of questions to be answered.
</I>

This one is a toughy. Too many callbacks and you're wasting CPU cycles
calling the hook notification functions (and any plugin callbacks that get
called as a result). Too few, and you lose the ability for plugins to get in
on the action.

What information the plugins have is also an interesting question. Looking
at the current song observers, it looks like they are passed the song
information; but what if a plugin what's to display something /else/, it
just happens to want to display it (or act on it) on song change? For
example, Leo's notification plugin -- something it doesn't do that I would
like is show a notification saying &quot;End of playlist.&quot; when the playlist
finishes, or &quot;Paused&quot; etc. whenever a control is commanded.

Allowing plugins to have access to the Sonata base class certainly gives
them access to any information they may want to take advantage of, but it
also gives them too much power over the core. I was briefly considering --
though I do not think this is a good way to go -- of implementing a
ReadOnlyBase class, which effectively would have a reference to the main
class instance, and then provide read-only interfaces to all of the
attributes. Too much overhead, I think -- there must be a simpler way to
access this.

Here's a nifty thought -- fresh off the presses in my mind, so I haven't
worked through it yet -- but a callback function could specify which
data/GUI controls it wants to have access to. When the plugin gets
registered with the core (or whatever happens), an object is built that
contains references to only those attributes. Then whenever that particular
callback is called, it gets passed this object. Hmm, thinking about this a
bit more, I think this might also have too much overhead. Something to come
back to, definitely.

&gt;<i> Each plugin module would also have a dictionary with all the plugin info,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i.e. license, author, name, description, etc.; whether or not there
</I>&gt;<i> should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be a &quot;Configure&quot; button in the plugins window (a la Firefox), and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why use a dictionary, when a class is essentially already a
</I>&gt;<i> dictionary? We can just lay down some guidelines as to what the
</I>&gt;<i> members of the class must be called, such as &quot;author&quot;, &quot;description&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. If we go with the inheritance style (which I'm not too excited
</I>&gt;<i> about yet) this could be as simple as making the required fields part
</I>&gt;<i> of the constructor.
</I>

Yeah.. I was kind of flip-flopping back and forth between the idea of a
plugin being a module vs. a plugin being an object instance/class. I have a
bad tendency to jump straight to OO fundamentals without fully thinking
through the applicability, even though I usually end up with a functional/OO
hybrid solution to stuff. But you're right, certainly a module/class with
specified attributes would work just as well as a dictionary. I suppose
either way, as long as you have a specification indicating what needs to be
provided and in what form, either one would work. Attributes might be a bit
cleaner, but would be more difficult to handle when missing (i.e. as opposed
to plugin.get('key','default')).


&gt;<i> &gt; This method allows the pluginsystem to simply locate plugin modules, load
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the information for the window, and then -- if enabled -- instatiate an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instance of the plugin. In true Pythonic fashion, any plugin shall act
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exactly as a Plugin object would -- that is, the rest of Sonata can treat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them all the same, with no special code based on what they plugin wants
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do, etc. This avoids having to parse plugin files for the configure info
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (let Python do the heavy lifting), and also allows pre-compiled plugin
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modules for faster importing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't entirely understand this but I think I get the general idea.
</I>&gt;<i> Unifying the plugins into a standard form sounds like a great idea.
</I>&gt;<i> Pre-compiled bytecode is nice too.
</I>

Sorry, I was starting to ramble. I tend not to think out what all I want to
say in advance, and it just kind of comes as I type. I think I was trying to
hammer home two disparate ideas here: first, that each plugin -- if
contained within it's own module -- could be imported directly, from
anywhere -- e.g. 'from SuperAwesomeGuysPluginPack import WickedCoolPlugin'.
This is less of a concern, but it avoids having to bring in and parse the
module manually if you could just do a simple import statement.

Second, the part you already got -- in Python, a function that does some
action on a particular type of object should be able to perform the
comperable action on any object type that it is reasonable to apply it to --
in particular, any subclasses of a class must only /extend/ a superclass.
But this starts to become less about typing and more about a specification
if you take away the focus on OO programming (which indeed may be overkill
here -- I'm not sure one needs  room for /instances/ of plugins so much...).


These are just my thoughts. If you have patches I can review it might
&gt;<i> be easier to understand what you want to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good discussion so far. I think any patches from my end will be quite far
away -- I'll be doing my work primarily locally and in Bazaar branches on
Launchpad (<A HREF="http://www.launchpad.net/~scott-armitage">http://www.launchpad.net/~scott-armitage</A>), but I think there's a
lot more to hash out first, especially if I'm going to try tackling a plugin
revamp.

If you want to rework the plugin framework, I think it might be easier
&gt;<i> to start fresh from the latest release. At least there you can easily
</I>&gt;<i> rip out (or ignore) the existing framework. Nowadays, some of the core
</I>&gt;<i> functionality (artwork, lyrics) has been moved into plugins, so
</I>&gt;<i> working from the trunk might be harder. Of course, that functionality
</I>&gt;<i> isn't essential, so it's probably ok either way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, you might want to talk with Tuukka &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sonata-users">Tuukka.Hastrup at iki.fi</A>&gt; as
</I>&gt;<i> he's the main push behind the plugins so far.
</I>

Thank you kindly for the input; I presume that Tuukka is subscribed to this
list, so I'll not bother him(?) about it just yet, but certainly as I start
getting a clearer picture of where I see this heading.
