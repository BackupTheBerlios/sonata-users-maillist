I hope people could understand the code and via documentation also the 
rationale behind it. The goal would be to let people work on the code 
instead of requiring them to wonder why on earth it is as it is.

&gt;<i> I thought the original system was distutils

</I>
distutils works for public modules and commands, but it doesn't have 
anything for plug-ins. The original system was based on setuptools, 
which includes functionality for defining capabilities in setup.py 
(although they call them entry points) pretty much as we do in metadata:
<A HREF="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins">http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins</A>

Depending on setuptools would be a risk, since not everything it does is 
accepted widely in the Python community, and it's future is thus 
unclear. Also, I'm not sure it can meet these requirements feasibly:
  * We want plug-in installation to be simple.
  * We want Sonata to work without installation.
  * We want Sonata to be able to download and install plug-ins.

&gt;&gt;<i> * If MPD changes or Sonata changes, the plug-in interface should remain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> backward-compatible (within reason).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are we too concerned about this? I thought we will be carrying most of
</I>&gt;<i> the plugins in our code base so changing the API shouldn't be too much
</I>&gt;<i> of a concern. I admit it's not pleasant, but we shouldn't contort the
</I>&gt;<i> code for backwards compatibility.
</I>
Right - so maybe the more important requirement here is that we don't 
want the ugly details of MPD and Sonata to taint the plug-in code :-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Currently, a plug-in is a module with the required metadata magic. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capabilities of a plug-in are currently described in the metadata to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meet a requirement:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * We may want to know the capabilities of a plug-in to decide when to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> load it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think if we go with the class style, we don't need to instantiate a
</I>&gt;<i> class to inspect the class members.
</I>
To inspect the class members, we'd need to import the code -- &quot;load the 
plug-in&quot;. A more concrete scenario I have in mind is that we may want 
plug-ins to add command line options but at that point, they can't 
import gtk.

&gt;&gt;<i> The decorator *syntax* might help here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, I meant to say syntax (or semantics). It still feels like a
</I>&gt;<i> pattern to me, but Wikipedia disagrees :-(
</I>
(In design patterns, the naming and details of the definition are 
important. This is not *the* Decorator Pattern :-) Further, you 
typically wouldn't call something provided by the language a design 
pattern.)

Just to expand on what I had in mind here, we could use the decorator 
syntax to mark the capability implementations (instead of the 
capabilities metadata):

@pluginsystem.capability('tab')
def construct_tab():
     ...

The implementation of pluginsystem.capability would need to refer to the 
calling module somehow though (to add the capability to the right 
plug-in). Further, I don't know how exactly this should work for objects.

&gt;<i> I think we just need some more competing implementations and we'll get
</I>&gt;<i> this all figured out ;-)
</I>
I'm not happy at the pace of my work, so new blood is definitely welcome.
