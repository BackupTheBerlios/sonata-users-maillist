<PRE>Hi all, long-time-listener, first-time-caller (except a few bugs back in the
day).

About a week ago, I ran into an issue where I was trying to interact with my
desktop when a song-change popup blocked the area I was trying to interact
with. I was slightly frustrated by this, and then I started thinking about
all of the usability enhancements Ubuntu has made with their Notify-OSD
daemon. I decided that passive-notifications were a more appropriate option
than the popup-tooltips that Sonata currently employs. So, I started hacking
away at 1.6.2 and quickly came up with something that works; I basically
modified the existing popup callbacks to send a notification using
`pynotify` (if the user had checked an additional box in preferences).
Worked great!

Then I started looking at how the code could be merged with the current SVN
version, and that's when I found Leo Iannacone's `notify.py` plugin, and in
fact the plugin system in general (I hadn't known this was coming down the
pipe). Basically, my reason for calling is this: I have some ideas to
enhance the notify plugin, however this requires a bit more flexibility in
the plugin system. From what I can see in the code, it seems like the only
plugin callback currently implemented is for `playing_song_observers`; is
this correct? I'm going to start working on adding some extra hooks to the
Sonata core to allow plugins to operate at a more general level.

Regards,
-Scott
