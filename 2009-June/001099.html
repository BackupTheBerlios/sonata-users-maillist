</I>&gt;<i> Plugin (i.e. `class NotifyPlugin(sonata.Plugin):` or some-such).
</I>
I agree, the magic stuff is gross. I think the first attempt at the
plugin infrastructure was good to smoke out some common problems and
help us figure out what we really need to do. It will probably take a
couple iterations to get it right though. We kind of just made a
plugin infrastructure without thinking about what the plugins would
need, or how they would interact with each other.

&gt;<i> You could have a fixed-name for the enablables (which needs a new name, by
</I>&gt;<i> the way) function/method that all plugins must provide. For registering
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks (i.e. hook notifications), you could just have a dictionary keyed
</I>&gt;<i> on hook-name, with the values being the method callables. (Alternatively,
</I>&gt;<i> you could have the plugin register it's callbacks with the pluginsystem
</I>&gt;<i> module in Sonata.. but I like the idea of Sonata core doing the work
</I>&gt;<i> instead. Then you just need to provide this dictionary, and the rest will be
</I>&gt;<i> handled by itself).
</I>
I was thinking that maybe a decorator pattern would work for
callbacks. I'm not sure though, and I haven't thought that through too
carefully. I guess the decorator would be registering the callback
with the core, which you don't like :-)

Also, what kind of callbacks should be provided? Maybe song change,
time change, tags change, play, stop, etc. Do we allow plugins to
affect the core, or do we sandbox them? If we allow plugins to change
the state we may get caught in infinite callback loops. If we have
competing artwork plugins, maybe an amazon artwork vs. a last.fm
artwork plugin, how do we make sure only one is enabled? As you can
see there are a lot of questions to be answered.

&gt;<i> Each plugin module would also have a dictionary with all the plugin info,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. license, author, name, description, etc.; whether or not there should
</I>&gt;<i> be a &quot;Configure&quot; button in the plugins window (a la Firefox), and so on.
</I>
Why use a dictionary, when a class is essentially already a
dictionary? We can just lay down some guidelines as to what the
members of the class must be called, such as &quot;author&quot;, &quot;description&quot;,
etc. If we go with the inheritance style (which I'm not too excited
about yet) this could be as simple as making the required fields part
of the constructor.

&gt;<i> This method allows the pluginsystem to simply locate plugin modules, load
</I>&gt;<i> the information for the window, and then -- if enabled -- instatiate an
</I>&gt;<i> instance of the plugin. In true Pythonic fashion, any plugin shall act
</I>&gt;<i> exactly as a Plugin object would -- that is, the rest of Sonata can treat
</I>&gt;<i> them all the same, with no special code based on what they plugin wants to
</I>&gt;<i> do, etc. This avoids having to parse plugin files for the configure info
</I>&gt;<i> (let Python do the heavy lifting), and also allows pre-compiled plugin
</I>&gt;<i> modules for faster importing.
</I>
I don't entirely understand this but I think I get the general idea.
Unifying the plugins into a standard form sounds like a great idea.
Pre-compiled bytecode is nice too.

These are just my thoughts. If you have patches I can review it might
be easier to understand what you want to do.

If you want to rework the plugin framework, I think it might be easier
to start fresh from the latest release. At least there you can easily
rip out (or ignore) the existing framework. Nowadays, some of the core
functionality (artwork, lyrics) has been moved into plugins, so
working from the trunk might be harder. Of course, that functionality
isn't essential, so it's probably ok either way.

Finally, you might want to talk with Tuukka &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sonata-users">Tuukka.Hastrup at iki.fi</A>&gt; as
he's the main push behind the plugins so far.
