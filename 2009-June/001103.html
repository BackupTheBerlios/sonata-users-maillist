I don't think documentation is necessary, just you pointing out where
we thought wrong is good enough for me. I have never implemented a
plugin system either, and it makes sense to investigate how others
have implemented them. I thought the original system was distutils
based, right? At least with that approach, the dependency management
is handled by distutils, and we don't have to reinvent the wheel for
capabilities. The downside is we depend on distutils and the system
becomes heavy-weight.

&gt;<i> * If MPD changes or Sonata changes, the plug-in interface should remain
</I>&gt;<i> backward-compatible (within reason).
</I>
Are we too concerned about this? I thought we will be carrying most of
the plugins in our code base so changing the API shouldn't be too much
of a concern. I admit it's not pleasant, but we shouldn't contort the
code for backwards compatibility.

&gt;<i> What you describe is generic to subtyping. Python style prefers duck
</I>&gt;<i> typing specifically, which means you don't require the objects of a type
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;to actually be instances of a (sub-)class. The requirement follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* We want that plug-ins don't have to extend a sonata.Plugin class.
</I>
I agree, there really isn't a need for an OO style. There's no real
object hierarchy to speak of.

&gt;<i> Currently, a plug-in is a module with the required metadata magic. The
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities of a plug-in are currently described in the metadata to
</I>&gt;<i> meet a requirement:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* We may want to know the capabilities of a plug-in to decide when to
</I>&gt;<i> load it.
</I>
I think if we go with the class style, we don't need to instantiate a
class to inspect the class members. In this way we could have the
capabilities be part of the class, not the instance. Then when we
decide it's time to use the plugin, we instantiate the class. When we
disable, we delete the class.

&gt;<i> The decorator *syntax* might help here.
</I>
Thanks, I meant to say syntax (or semantics). It still feels like a
pattern to me, but Wikipedia disagrees :-(

&gt;<i> There is some exploration of the current system being used in the OO
</I>&gt;<i> style plus commentary by the developer here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://github.com/github076986099/sonata-plugins/tree/master">http://github.com/github076986099/sonata-plugins/tree/master</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As can be seen here, the life cycle model needs to be designed
</I>&gt;<i> carefully. Python modules are loaded but never unloaded, so we need
</I>&gt;<i> something like the current &quot;enablables&quot; capability for setup and
</I>&gt;<i> teardown (if it should be possible to disable plug-ins at runtime). The
</I>&gt;<i> capability can instantiate classes, and other capabilities can refer to
</I>&gt;<i> methods in the resulting objects (sonata/pluginsystem.py line 81).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks for pointing out this OO style implementation. I'll have to
look over this to get some more ideas.

I think we just need some more competing implementations and we'll get
this all figured out ;-)
