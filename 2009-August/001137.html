Hi.

As I suffer from the same problem, I took a look at it (using
sonata latest SVN head and mpd 0.15.1) and here is what I've been able
to find, I hope this can help solve the problem (sorry if some elements
(the two first ones in particular) are obvious to people who know the
internals of sonata as it is not my case):

 - the iterate method (which queries mpd status and also calls the
scrobbler.iterate and scrobbler.handle_change_status methods) is called
once per second when no track is played and twice per second when
something is played.

 - the scrobbler.iterate method is called every time main.iterate is
called whereas the scrobbler.handle_change_status method is only
called, you guessed it, when mpd status has changed;

 - the time returned by mpd is not precise at all (sometimes when
called at two different instants distant from more than 1 second, mpd
returns the same playing time). This means that the status does not
change every second;

 - from the two previous points, we can deduce that the ratio between
the number of calls to scrobbler.iterate and
scrobbler.handle_change_status is not fixed (in my tests, is usually
varies between 1 and 3);

 - the way the scrob_playing_duration is calculated seems pretty
strange to me: &quot;self.scrob_playing_duration += time.time() -
self.scrob_time_now&quot;. What is calculated here is the delay between this
call to handle_change_status and the previous call to
scrobbler.iterate. As the scrobbler.iterate method is called every 500
ms, this value is always around 500 ms (a very small bit larger than
500 ms in fact as the code is more complex in
scrobbler.handle_change_status);

 - from the two previous points, we can conclude that the scrobbling
time is incremented at somewhat random times by an almost constant value
of 500 ms. Hence the final value which is completely different from the
real playing time. I did not get the same results as Tuuka concerning
the difference between CBR and VBR files but this may be explained by
the fact that the bitrate of the VBR file I used does not vary much. In
the &quot;best&quot; (or is it the worst?) case where a track has its bitrate
modified every 500 ms, the mpd status will be modified every 500 ms and
thus both methods (scrobbler.iterate and
scrobbler.handle_change_status) will be called every time -&gt; this will
produce a correct scrob_playing_duration.

As for the solution, I don't really know the correct way to fix this
problem unfortunately... Maybe simply using the playing time returned
by mpd? But I suppose that this doesn't work in some situation...

Hope this helped a bit.

Thanks and best regards,
Emmanuel

PS: for the curious, I've put the two log files (which are quite
unreadable) here: <A HREF="http://emmanuel.viaud.free.fr/sonata/">http://emmanuel.viaud.free.fr/sonata/</A>
I've basically added some debug lines in main.iterate
(&quot;main.iterate_time&quot; and the content of self.status), scrobbler.iterate
('Iterate, time is &quot;) and scrobbler.handle_change_status (&quot;mpd
time now:&quot;, Tuuka's line and &quot;scrob_time_now&quot; and friends).
