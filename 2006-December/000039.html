</I>
Well, the problem is not so as to having a hard time finding the
songs, it's to quickly jump to the song I want to hear by simply
entering a few words of the song and getting a small match set and
select one of the matches. I can understand it being slow, so I'm
wondering what you mean by a 'large' playlist?

If I understood it correctly Sonata is written in Python and if so it
should be &quot;easy&quot; to hack the search function in in which case I might
give it a go when I have some free time. I'd be happy to submit some
sort of patch if I ever complete it.

&gt;<i> I would consider this at some point, but it definitely wouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> anytime soon if I decide to include it.  I don't know of any MPD
</I>&gt;<i> clients that allow editing tag information, presumably because MPD

</I>
This is just about me trying to use as few tools as possible, and I've
grown used to be able to use my media player to edit tags as needed.
If I can get away with using one application less I'm happier then
having to switch between applications.

&gt;<i> Showing song lengths is available in svn, although I don't think there
</I>&gt;<i> is any way to right-justify the text in a single column. And I'm
</I>&gt;<i> hesitant to introduce multiple columns to the interface..
</I>
Nice, and I agree, I wouldn't want mutliple columns as well, I like
the interface as it is at the moment.

Would it be possible to add an option to show the track number as well
as from which album the current song is from? And only show it if
album information is available.

Something like this:
&lt;song&gt;
by &lt;artist&gt; from &lt;album&gt;, track &lt;#&gt;
