You can post requests here or anywhere else that gets my attention ;)

I'm guessing you mean searching/filtering the current playlist and not
the library (where you can search based on title, artist, etc). The
problem with on-the-fly filtering is that it can be VERY slow when you
have a large playlist, and I don't think it's something that most
users would use. Sorting the playlist will be available in the next
version of Sonata, maybe that will alleviate your problem of finding
songs? Sorry but it's not something I'm likely to include.

&gt;<i> I'd also like to be able to edit the tags of the file though I think that
</I>&gt;<i> would require some work since the different music formats use different tag
</I>&gt;<i> formats.
</I>
I would consider this at some point, but it definitely wouldn't be
anytime soon if I decide to include it.  I don't know of any MPD
clients that allow editing tag information, presumably because MPD
itself doesn't provide any interface for it. There are already some
great tools like easytag.

&gt;<i>Showing the length of the songs in the playlist would be nice
</I>&gt;<i> (aligned right if possible would be even nicer).
</I>
Showing song lengths is available in svn, although I don't think there
is any way to right-justify the text in a single column. And I'm
hesitant to introduce multiple columns to the interface..

Scott
