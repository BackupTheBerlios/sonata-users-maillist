To be fair, tiling window managers have their share of issues as well.
For example, Sonata has the ability to expand/collapse the window, but
tiling WMs won't allow the window to be resized. And I disagree with
the principle that WMs should be using different rulesets on different
window classes - all windows should be treated equally and the
applications should be implementing different behaviors, in my
opinion. This is not to say that non-tiling WMs are perfect by any
stretch of the imagination, just that people clearly disagree on the
role window managers should play.

Regardless, Sonata has been a tabbed application from the start (the
very first version integrated pygmy's playlist and library windows
into tabs). For people that don't use dual-widescreen monitors or
whatever else people use these days, it makes sense not to waste the
screen real estate with two windows. I can't make everyone happy with
the changes I make, but I _can_ make myself happy. And so that's what
I did :-)
