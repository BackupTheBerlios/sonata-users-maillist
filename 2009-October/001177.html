<PRE>&gt;<i> Perhaps this is the only piece missing from your patch. Suppose I play,
</I>&gt;<i> then pause the song, grab a cup of coffee and then come back and press
</I>&gt;<i> play. My now playing on last.fm will be nothing because we only update
</I>&gt;<i> now playing once. It seems that last.fm doesn't keep the now playing up
</I>&gt;<i> for much longer than the actual length of the song sent.
</I>Well, that's easily enough fixed, the call to np() just needs to be
moved up to the part that handles playing/resuming.
&gt;<i>Nevermind. Merge error on my part. I'd like to apply this onto the
</I>&gt;<i>maint-1.6.2 branch but I suppose something is different there.
</I>
&gt;<i>Commit 27bd1fc5d28276686c493510bac4aa988558d2be is what I'm applying onto.
</I>I wrote it for a8562e8a9f8d325416f5d3896e129b97c46ec7bc, as it's both
the current tip of master and the current HEAD. It actually applies
just fine to both. Which is to say, that bug occurs in both. The
problem is that it assumes a stop-&gt;pause/play transition before use,
which, in the case of it being disabled at startup and then enabling
scrobbling mid-song, doesn't occur.

The attached patch fixes both these problems. Note that you can't
simply initialize the attributes in scrobbler.__init__(). While that
avoids the exception, it trades it off for instead possibly incorrect
(possibly *very* incorrect) play durations on the song that's playing
when scrobbling is enabled. Which is less bad, but still not good.
