</I>Not really too hard to do, the current code already does it. I was
just saying that that code would have to be moved outside of
scrobbler.py, because it'd be impossible to do from within it when
it's only called on state transitions.
&gt;<i> Simple is good, but I think a state based approach is easier to

</I>Of course. It was just 'make it stop completely breaking on me' at the
time though, redesigning all of it wasn't really a major priority.
&gt;<i> I forgot to add submit a track when a percentage of time is played. But
</I>&gt;<i> that's probably obvious ;-)
</I>Actually, no. See <A HREF="http://www.last.fm/api/submissions.">http://www.last.fm/api/submissions.</A> You're only
supposed to submit it when the track has ended playing.

I've attached to this message a patch implementing the state
transition-based handle_change_status(), which I've tested a bit and
am currently using. A few notes:
* I still have everything in one function, because splitting it into
one function for each state would, of course, require its own function
definition, all of which would be basically the same, there's code
that would need to be duplicated across some of them because it runs
on multiple transitions, main.py would need to be able to call each of
the functions depending on the state instead of just calling a single
one, and so on. Overall it'd be less readable, have more code, and in
particular more *redundant* code.
* A number of initializations of attributes in Scrobbler.__init__()
have been scrapped. Some of these are no longer used, and with the
others, it shouldn't be possible for them to be used before they're
set elsewhere anyway.
* Also in main.py's handle_change_status(), a few variables aren't
always set, but it is again a case of &quot;will never be used when they're
unset anyway&quot;.
