The significant change is the wrong change to make because it adds more
complexity. I merely suggested it might be better to try another
approach, but it didn't work out as well as I had hoped. You were
willing to try the idea out (which I thank you for), but I never said I
wouldn't accept your first patch. I was just hoping another approach
could clean up the code and solve the bug in a nicer way. I'm sorry you
spent significant effort on something you feel has been a waste. It
hasn't been a waste at all.

It's layed the groundwork for the scrobbler code to be transitioned to
some event/edge-triggered framework in the future. It's also highlighted
some issues with that transition and what kind of support the framework
should provide. Plus we've discovered that scrobbling doesn't work well
when enabled mid-song. All important things that can only improve the code.

</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, you now have a few working patches on this issue to do with as
</I>&gt;<i> you please.
</I>
Thanks. I've applied the first patch and queued it for the next
maintenance release.
