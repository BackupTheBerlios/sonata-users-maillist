I sense you've lost interest/motivation. Please don't get discouraged.

What I suggested didn't seem to work out very well, so I think lets just
apply the first patch you wrote and come back to cleaning up the
scrobbler later.

Is there anything missing, besides the

    if state != 'pause' or prevstate != 'pause'

part you talked about earlier?
