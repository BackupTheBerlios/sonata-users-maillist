</I>You've duplicated it to __init__(), in case you didn't notice. And
with it being in __init__() like that, it makes the assumption that
the scrobbler object is used very soon after it's set. Which is true
with the current code, but I'm not particularly comfortable with that
sort of unnecessary and rather subtle coupling of modules.
&gt;<i> We already have code to detect state transitions. Your detection of song

</I>&gt;<i> more of this approach (applied on top of your patch as it helped me get

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>[snip code]
</I>Besides the problem mentioned above, your code doesn't properly handle
switching from a paused track to another one; play() will be called
first above before song_change() below, overwriting the data of the
old song before it can be posted. Additionally, play() doesn't just
set things up for posting when you first play a song, it does it every
time, so it np()s unnecessarily and can post with incorrect start
times. Very incorrect if you, for example, happen to pause near the
end of a song and then resume. And my complaint that it adds more code
for no real gain still stands.

But beyond that, there doesn't seem to be any problems, so if you fix
those, feel free to go ahead with it.
