</I>I'm going to have to be blunt here. You have suggested a significant
change, left it to someone else to invest the not-insignificant effort
to make, test, and refine a patch for this change, and then at a
moment's notice, unilaterally decided to scrap it on the basis that it
is a significant change. I don't think there's anyone who wouldn't be
even the slightest bit discouraged over this.
&gt;<i> What I suggested didn't seem to work out very well, so I think lets just
</I>&gt;<i> apply the first patch you wrote and come back to cleaning up the

</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;if state != 'pause' or prevstate != 'pause'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> part you talked about earlier?
</I>That's stupid and I was stupid when I said it. It obviously horribly
breaks the calculations, please don't do that. As for the rest of the
patch, there's a lot that could be cleaned up, but at least at a very
quick glance, nothing really wrong.

Anyway, you now have a few working patches on this issue to do with as
you please. I have expended far more effort on this than I ever
planned, and there's not really anything else to be done here anymore,
so I shall bow out.
