I think it was the implied subject in some sentences. I was wondering to
myself what &quot;it&quot; was.

&gt;<i> I originally considered that, but I wasn't sure if it was acceptable
</I>&gt;<i> or if Sonata's trying to keep compatibility with older versions of
</I>&gt;<i> Python like some projects. Grepping around I now see there's already a
</I>&gt;<i> few usages of the if-else expression, so I guess I was being overly
</I>&gt;<i> cautious.
</I>
We have a &gt;=python-2.5 so the one line if-else syntax can be used if
appropriate.

&gt;&gt;<i> Does this mean we update the time even when the song is paused? Consider
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the case where I change the volume while the song is paused. My
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scrobbler time goes up? Is this a bug currently when the song is stopped
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and I change the volume?
</I>&gt;<i> No, look down to where it updates scrob_playing_duration. It's only
</I>&gt;<i> updated if the previous state isn't 'pause'. It's there to add
</I>&gt;<i> whatever bit of playtime was left over when it's first paused. Though,
</I>&gt;<i> looking over it again, it should've been &quot;if state != 'pause' or
</I>&gt;<i> prevstate != 'pause'&quot; instead, as just checking prevstate will make it
</I>&gt;<i> not count the first call after it resumes playing.
</I>
Ok, thanks.

&gt;<i> You'd also need to move the code that detects
</I>&gt;<i> when the same song is played twice in a row out into main.py and then
</I>&gt;<i> have it call the stop function for the old song and start for the new
</I>&gt;<i> one, as there'd be no way for it to be detected from within
</I>&gt;<i> scrobbler.py with that sort of setup. Though with my patch I was
</I>&gt;<i> really just going for the simplest thing that would work. Most of my
</I>&gt;<i> library is in FLAC and with the most recent mpd update, mpd only seems
</I>&gt;<i> to update the status for FLAC files at about ~1.5 second intervals, so
</I>&gt;<i> it kinda pretty much completely broke last.fm support for me.
</I>
The song playing twice in a row is a tough case to handle. I'd be fine
with a follow-up patch for that. Simple is good, but I think a state
based approach is easier to maintain in the long run. Smaller functions
that do one thing are always nice too.

&gt;&gt;<i> * When the song stops, we should post the song if it hasn't been posted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already and meets time requirements. Also reset the clock to zero, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * If the song changes, we should reset our clock and add the new song to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> audioscrobbler's cache.
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, that's about all.
</I>
I forgot to add submit a track when a percentage of time is played. But
that's probably obvious ;-)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I might hack on the code a bit, try out the edge-triggered idea, it
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't take too much effort to code. 
</I>
Thanks.

&gt;<i> Also, apologies to anyone who
</I>&gt;<i> tries to directly apply the patch in the original post; Gmail saw fit
</I>&gt;<i> to murder it with word wrap. I'll make sure not to use Gmail's web
</I>&gt;<i> client for sending patches in the future.
</I>
I use git-send-email and ssmtp due to this problem.
