Ah, thanks. I'm inclined to just apply your patch for now. I'll leave
splitting it up into functions for someone to take care of later.

&gt;<i>  Additionally, play() doesn't just
</I>&gt;<i> set things up for posting when you first play a song, it does it every
</I>&gt;<i> time, so it np()s unnecessarily and can post with incorrect start

</I>&gt;<i> end of a song and then resume. And my complaint that it adds more code
</I>&gt;<i> for no real gain still stands

Perhaps this is the only piece missing from your patch. Suppose I play,
then pause the song, grab a cup of coffee and then come back and press
play. My now playing on last.fm will be nothing because we only update
now playing once. It seems that last.fm doesn't keep the now playing up
for much longer than the actual length of the song sent.
