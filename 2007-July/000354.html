<PRE>This is mainly directed to Scott since I've told him about the problem
elsewhere, but I figured the proper place to report it was the list.
With both the last released version of Sonata and the SVN version,
Sonata seems to lose its connection with mpd when mpd takes a while to
respond.

My setup is the following: Sonata and mpd are running on computer A,
and computer B holds my music, which is mounted over NFS to computer
A.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start sonata and mpd
2. Play some music
3. Stop the music playing, leave Sonata and mpd running
4. Wait for the hard drive holding the music on computer B to spin
down (suspend)
5. Press play in Sonata- this son will usually play because it is
cached on computer A
6. Skip to the next track- the remote drive will spin up, but Sonata
times out and displays &quot;Stopped&quot; as the status, even though mpd will
eventually queue up and play the song

Doing Alt-C then updates the status in Sonata, but it does not
continuously update- it simply stays where it was when you did the
Alt-C. Repeated presses of Alt-C will update the status. In addition,
the buttons will then work and you can skip around songs, although the
status does not update except at the moment you press the buttons.

Let me know if you need anything else on this. The only way to fix the
problem seems to be to restart Sonata.
