<PRE>Hi there,

I'm pleased to announce a new (alpha!) release of Sonata!

Sonata is a graphical client for the Music Player Daemon, written in
Python 3 and using GTK+ 3. It is available on the following Git
repository: <A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata/">https://github.com/multani/sonata/</A>

What's new in 1.7a2?
====================

This release is primarily done for those who want to use Sonata with the
latest MPD 0.18 since previous versions of Sonata are known to have
troubles.

Still, there are a few other small features:

    - bigger covers from Last.fm
    - new translations and a new translation system (see below)
    - tagpy v2013.1 restores tagging facilities in Sonata, broken since
      the Python 3 port
    - and dozen of bug fixed...

Have a look at the changelog at
<A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata/blob/v1.7a2/CHANGELOG">https://github.com/multani/sonata/blob/v1.7a2/CHANGELOG</A> for the details!

New translation system
----------------------

A few months ago, I set up a project on Transiflex in order to improve
the translation of Sonata. You can have a look here
<A HREF="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/sonata/">https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/sonata/</A> for the current state of
translations and propose new or improved ones if you feel it!
The TRANSLATORS file in the Sonata's Git repository should be up-to-date
to reflect how to submit translations, but feel free to send me
improvements if it's not clear enough.

What's next?
============

As you can see, Sonata's development is quite slow, although not dead
yet. At the moment, it is mostly bug-fixes-driven and would probably
greatly profit from new contributors.
I'll also have less time in the future to do improvements and fixes to
the code base so I gladly welcome any patches and people who wants to be
involved into this project. There are gazillions things to do here and
there, from small tasks to big refactoring and I can surely give some
advices to those interested!

Where to I get this already?
============================

The code can be find in the Git repository at
<A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata">https://github.com/multani/sonata</A> or you can grab a tarball at the
following address:
<A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata/archive/v1.7a2.tar.gz">https://github.com/multani/sonata/archive/v1.7a2.tar.gz</A>

Bugs should be preferably reported on Github at
<A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata/issues">https://github.com/multani/sonata/issues</A> or here on the mailing-list.

If you have patches which add new features, improve Sonata or fix bugs,
you can submit them as pull requests on Github at
<A HREF="https://github.com/multani/sonata/pulls">https://github.com/multani/sonata/pulls</A> or here on the mailing list.


Thanks for the people still interested and involved in Sonata so far!

 Jonathan
