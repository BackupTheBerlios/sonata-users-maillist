<PRE>Hi

Maybe I'm doing something wrong - but I never saw a lyrics tab - how can I do that?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them and so I have set the song line to {%A}{ - %B} to show nothing in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; such case. When I switch between such stream and a normal file (with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Artist and Album name tags) the interface jumps similar to the (fixed)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bug &quot;interface jumping because of progress bar font&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ahh, I see the issue now. It should be fixed, thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When I mark all at once and click to add them to the playlist it takes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10 seconds before the UI is responsible again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think there's much I can do about this.. I can make the UI
</I>&gt;<i> more responsive when doing this, but it's not going to shorten how
</I>&gt;<i> long the process takes. The beginning of each stream needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> retrieved to determine if it's a playlist or a stream, and then
</I>&gt;<i> depends wholly on how fast the stream's server sends data. The
</I>&gt;<i> checking and parsing work on Sonata's end is very quick.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now that I know about pls I have tested it too but it doesn't always
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work. Here are some streams which doesn't work:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I actually fixed this issue in svn right before I got your email ;) I
</I>&gt;<i> imagine it also fixes your issue with a lot of shoutcast streams not
</I>&gt;<i> working too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some other thing: When I have a long playlist and doubleclick on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stream at the end of the list, the playlist jumps to the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would be better if it stayed where I had scrolled it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Argh.. I had never noticed this before. Playing a stream actually
</I>&gt;<i> causes the mpd playlist to change/increment, which ends up refreshing
</I>&gt;<i> the current playlist, among other things. What a pain.. I have an ugly
</I>&gt;<i> workaround so that the playlist doesn't jump now, hopefully it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> break anything.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For what it's worth, mpd streaming support is pretty poor/buggy..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can only speak for amazon.de. It has many covers that aren't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available on amazon.com (mostly national artists). I don't know if it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works exactly like the main amazon.com site but some other players
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (e.g. exaile) have this function so it seems to work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll look into this at some point in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As mentioned above shoutcast streams have set only the song name tag.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But this tag contains the artist AND the song name: &quot;artist - song&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thus searching for lyrics should be possible but the lyrics tab shows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Artist or song title not set&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How is Sonata to know that both the artist and song are in the song
</I>&gt;<i> name tag? Is it supposed to assume that a '-' in the song means this?
</I>&gt;<i> There's obviously a huge number of situations where that doesn't work
</I>&gt;<i> (hyphenated words). Do other clients look for this sort of thing? I
</I>&gt;<i> hate to add specific code to work around problems with shoutcast
</I>&gt;<i> streams that don't properly set their tags.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I have thrown up a new tarball.. please test your issues
</I>&gt;<i> (anyone else is welcome to as well ;p).
