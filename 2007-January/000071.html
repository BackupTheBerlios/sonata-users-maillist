<PRE>Hello!

First, I want to say thanks for Sonata. It's almost that what I was
searching for and it has replaced audacious in my everyday use.

Second, I have tested version 0.9.9 in the last days and it seems to be
pretty stable. I had no crashes or freezes. Nevertheless I have some
comments/questions:

When I close sonata in collapsed state and open it again the statusbar
is visible.

I have &quot;{%A}{ - %B}&quot; in Current song line 2. When I switch between
songs with and without artist and album tags the interface is jumping.

The new Icon seems to be slimmer than the old one which I liked more.

There is no function to rename Streams and Playlists.

When I add more than one stream at once to the playlist, sonata hangs
for some seconds. Is there anything going on in the background?

With expanded playlist Sonata jumps to the playing song. It would be
nice if it does the same when a collapsed playlist is expanded.

I would like it, if the volume slider was always visible as in some
other clients (and not just a button).

Song Info for songs which are not playing at the moment would be good.

Is amazon.com used for covers? Will there be the possibility to change
it to a local amazon.* site?

The usability of the remote cover window could be improved. When no
cover is found automatically, then I have to open the remote cover
window, wait some seconds, click in the &quot;No cover art found&quot; dialog and
expand the search terms. I think it would be better without the extra
&quot;no cover&quot; dialog  if nothing is found (make it like in the lyrics tab).
Moreover the search term editing should be always expanded.

The lyrics window isn't resizable. Sometimes a lyricsline is wider than
the window and so I have to scroll horizontally.

A possibility for entering search terms in the lyrics tab might be a
good idea (as in the remote cover window).

Lyrics doesn't work with shoutcast streams because they have only set
the song name tag (with artist and song name in it).

Which site is used to download the lyrics?

What does the option &quot;Play enqueued files on activate&quot; do?


Alex
