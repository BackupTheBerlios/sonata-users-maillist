<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; With expanded playlist Sonata jumps to the playing song. It would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nice if it does the same when a collapsed playlist is expanded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good idea. Done.
</I>
In most cases it seems to work now but sometimes it doesn't. It's hard
to reproduce. When I scroll a long playlist to the middle, doubleclick
on a song there, collapse and expand the playlist several times
(up to 20 times) then the playing song isn't in the visible area. I
know this isn't a typical use case but I wanted to mention it.

&gt;<i> &gt; I think it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hard to show in screenshots so I will try to explain. Shoutcast
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; streams usually have set only the song name tag. I don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have &quot;Unknown - Unknown&quot; in Current song line 2 when listening to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them and so I have set the song line to {%A}{ - %B} to show nothing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in such case. When I switch between such stream and a normal file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (with Artist and Album name tags) the interface jumps similar to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the (fixed) bug &quot;interface jumping because of progress bar font&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ahh, I see the issue now. It should be fixed, thanks.
</I>
The interface still jumps when the GTK font is DejaVu Sans 10. With
font size 8 it works.

&gt;<i> Argh.. I had never noticed this before. Playing a stream actually
</I>&gt;<i> causes the mpd playlist to change/increment, which ends up refreshing
</I>&gt;<i> the current playlist, among other things. What a pain.. I have an ugly
</I>&gt;<i> workaround so that the playlist doesn't jump now, hopefully it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> break anything.
</I>
When I have only one stream in the playlist and want to play it I get:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/sonata.py&quot;, line 1142, in
    iterate self.handle_change_status()
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/sonata.py&quot;, line 2194, in
    handle_change_status self.update_playlist()
  File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/sonata.py&quot;, line 2411, in
    update_playlist print self.currentdata[i][1], item
IndexError: could not find tree path

Moreover the playlist isn't updated when playing a stream. I think the
string in the playlist should be updated when tags in the stream are
updated.

&gt;<i> &gt; As mentioned above shoutcast streams have set only the song name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tag. But this tag contains the artist AND the song name: &quot;artist -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; song&quot; Thus searching for lyrics should be possible but the lyrics
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tab shows &quot;Artist or song title not set&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How is Sonata to know that both the artist and song are in the song
</I>&gt;<i> name tag? Is it supposed to assume that a '-' in the song means this?
</I>&gt;<i> There's obviously a huge number of situations where that doesn't work
</I>&gt;<i> (hyphenated words). Do other clients look for this sort of thing? I
</I>&gt;<i> hate to add specific code to work around problems with shoutcast
</I>&gt;<i> streams that don't properly set their tags.
</I>
Amarok has this function but they use lyrc.com.ar. You are right, it
would be a hacky solution to parse for the hyphen. Sometimes the
track number or the album name are also in the song name tag.
Unfortunately the majority of shoutcast streams have only set the song
name tag and no artist tag.

The other things seem to be fixed.
