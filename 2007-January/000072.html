&gt;<i> Hello!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, I want to say thanks for Sonata. It's almost that what I was
</I>&gt;<i> searching for and it has replaced audacious in my everyday use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, I have tested version 0.9.9 in the last days and it seems to be
</I>&gt;<i> pretty stable. I had no crashes or freezes. Nevertheless I have some
</I>&gt;<i> comments/questions:
</I>
Good to hear :)

&gt;<i> When I close sonata in collapsed state and open it again the statusbar
</I>&gt;<i> is visible.
</I>
Thanks, fixed.

&gt;<i> I have &quot;{%A}{ - %B}&quot; in Current song line 2. When I switch between
</I>&gt;<i> songs with and without artist and album tags the interface is jumping.
</I>
I'm either not seeing this or not understanding what you mean by the
interface is jumping. Can you provide before and after screenshots to
illustrate?

&gt;<i> The new Icon seems to be slimmer than the old one which I liked more.
</I>
Sorry, but I prefer the new one :P The old one was awfully plain and fat.

&gt;<i> There is no function to rename Streams and Playlists.
</I>
I had removed these at one point because the menus were getting
cluttered.. but, as someone pointed out, it seemed this way because I
had icons for every menu item. Now that the icons have been toned
down, you're right, it makes sense to bring these back. I already have
a string freeze in place for translators, so it'll have to wait for
version 1.0.1.

&gt;<i> When I add more than one stream at once to the playlist, sonata hangs
</I>&gt;<i> for some seconds. Is there anything going on in the background?
</I>
It depends on a couple of things. But to be concise, Sonata has to
retrieve a portion of the stream before adding it to test if it's a
pls/m3u or a simple stream, and if it's a pls/m3u, it has to parse and
add multiple items. If you could link me to the specific streams
you're testing with, I'll look into it a bit more.

&gt;<i> With expanded playlist Sonata jumps to the playing song. It would be
</I>&gt;<i> nice if it does the same when a collapsed playlist is expanded.
</I>
Good idea. Done.

&gt;<i> I would like it, if the volume slider was always visible as in some
</I>&gt;<i> other clients (and not just a button).
</I>
Sorry, this isn't going to happen, I think that's a waste of space for
an uncommon task. You can always just mousewheel over the volume
button anyway.

&gt;<i> Song Info for songs which are not playing at the moment would be good.
</I>
See the previous message in the mailing list about this. The majority
of feedback I got went against this idea, and I personally prefer the
current method of syncing to the playing song as well.

&gt;<i> Is amazon.com used for covers? Will there be the possibility to change
</I>&gt;<i> it to a local amazon.* site?
</I>
Yes. What is the benefit of this, just lower pings? Will it work
exactly like the main amazon.com site? I'm honestly ignorant about
non-US things like this ;-)

&gt;<i> The usability of the remote cover window could be improved. When no
</I>&gt;<i> cover is found automatically, then I have to open the remote cover
</I>&gt;<i> window, wait some seconds, click in the &quot;No cover art found&quot; dialog and
</I>&gt;<i> expand the search terms. I think it would be better without the extra
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;no cover&quot; dialog  if nothing is found (make it like in the lyrics tab).
</I>
Okay, the error info is now directly in the cover window.

&gt;<i> Moreover the search term editing should be always expanded.
</I>
I don't see why.. if tags are set correctly, users should rarely have
to use this.

&gt;<i> The lyrics window isn't resizable. Sometimes a lyricsline is wider than
</I>&gt;<i> the window and so I have to scroll horizontally.
</I>
Okay, it's now resizable. I've also turned on word wrapping.

&gt;<i> A possibility for entering search terms in the lyrics tab might be a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea (as in the remote cover window).
</I>
Yeah, there are a lot of additional things that could be added to the
lyrics.. but that will be for a feature release.

&gt;<i> Lyrics doesn't work with shoutcast streams because they have only set
</I>&gt;<i> the song name tag (with artist and song name in it).
</I>
I'm not sure what you want Sonata to do about this.

&gt;<i> Which site is used to download the lyrics?
</I>
lyricwiki.org

&gt;<i> What does the option &quot;Play enqueued files on activate&quot; do?
</I>
When you double-click (or press enter) on an item, it both queues and
plays the item instead of just queuing.

Thanks for all the feedback, it was very helpful (and good timing :p).

Scott
