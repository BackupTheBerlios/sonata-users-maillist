<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; I have &quot;{%A}{ - %B}&quot; in Current song line 2. When I switch between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; songs with and without artist and album tags the interface is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jumping.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm either not seeing this or not understanding what you mean by the
</I>&gt;<i> interface is jumping. Can you provide before and after screenshots to
</I>&gt;<i> illustrate?
</I>
I think it's hard to show in screenshots so I will try to explain.
Shoutcast streams usually have set only the song name tag. I don't want
to have &quot;Unknown - Unknown&quot; in Current song line 2 when listening to
them and so I have set the song line to {%A}{ - %B} to show nothing in
such case. When I switch between such stream and a normal file (with
Artist and Album name tags) the interface jumps similar to the (fixed)
bug &quot;interface jumping because of progress bar font&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; When I add more than one stream at once to the playlist, sonata
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hangs for some seconds. Is there anything going on in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; background?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It depends on a couple of things. But to be concise, Sonata has to
</I>&gt;<i> retrieve a portion of the stream before adding it to test if it's a
</I>&gt;<i> pls/m3u or a simple stream, and if it's a pls/m3u, it has to parse and
</I>&gt;<i> add multiple items. If you could link me to the specific streams
</I>&gt;<i> you're testing with, I'll look into it a bit more.
</I>
I have tested it with simple shoutcast streams. I haven't known that it
is possible to use pls or m3u. Here are 10 streams which I have in my
streams tab:

<A HREF="http://193.202.9.42:8000/">http://193.202.9.42:8000/</A>

When I mark all at once and click to add them to the playlist it takes
10 seconds before the UI is responsible again.

Now that I know about pls I have tested it too but it doesn't always
work. Here are some streams which doesn't work:

<A HREF="http://www.idobi.com/radio/iradio.pls">http://www.idobi.com/radio/iradio.pls</A>
<A HREF="http://www.punkrockers-radio.de/listen.pls">http://www.punkrockers-radio.de/listen.pls</A>

Moreover a lot of shoutcast streams from www.shoutcast.com doesn't
work. It works if I extract the stream URLs manually.

Some other thing: When I have a long playlist and doubleclick on a
stream at the end of the list, the playlist jumps to the beginning.
It would be better if it stayed where I had scrolled it.

&gt;<i> &gt; Is amazon.com used for covers? Will there be the possibility to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change it to a local amazon.* site?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. What is the benefit of this, just lower pings? Will it work
</I>&gt;<i> exactly like the main amazon.com site? I'm honestly ignorant about
</I>&gt;<i> non-US things like this ;-)
</I>
I can only speak for amazon.de. It has many covers that aren't
available on amazon.com (mostly national artists). I don't know if it
works exactly like the main amazon.com site but some other players
(e.g. exaile) have this function so it seems to work.

&gt;<i> &gt; Lyrics doesn't work with shoutcast streams because they have only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set the song name tag (with artist and song name in it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you want Sonata to do about this.
</I>
As mentioned above shoutcast streams have set only the song name tag.
But this tag contains the artist AND the song name: &quot;artist - song&quot;
Thus searching for lyrics should be possible but the lyrics tab shows
&quot;Artist or song title not set&quot;.
