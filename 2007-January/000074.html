Ahh, I see the issue now. It should be fixed, thanks.

&gt;<i> When I mark all at once and click to add them to the playlist it takes
</I>&gt;<i> 10 seconds before the UI is responsible again.
</I>
I don't think there's much I can do about this.. I can make the UI
more responsive when doing this, but it's not going to shorten how
long the process takes. The beginning of each stream needs to be
retrieved to determine if it's a playlist or a stream, and then
depends wholly on how fast the stream's server sends data. The
checking and parsing work on Sonata's end is very quick.

&gt;<i> Now that I know about pls I have tested it too but it doesn't always
</I>&gt;<i> work. Here are some streams which doesn't work:

I actually fixed this issue in svn right before I got your email ;) I
imagine it also fixes your issue with a lot of shoutcast streams not
working too.

&gt;<i> Some other thing: When I have a long playlist and doubleclick on a
</I>&gt;<i> stream at the end of the list, the playlist jumps to the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be better if it stayed where I had scrolled it.
</I>
Argh.. I had never noticed this before. Playing a stream actually
causes the mpd playlist to change/increment, which ends up refreshing
the current playlist, among other things. What a pain.. I have an ugly
workaround so that the playlist doesn't jump now, hopefully it doesn't
break anything.

For what it's worth, mpd streaming support is pretty poor/buggy..

&gt;<i> I can only speak for amazon.de. It has many covers that aren't
</I>&gt;<i> available on amazon.com (mostly national artists). I don't know if it
</I>&gt;<i> works exactly like the main amazon.com site but some other players
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. exaile) have this function so it seems to work.
</I>
I'll look into this at some point in the future.

&gt;<i> As mentioned above shoutcast streams have set only the song name tag.
</I>&gt;<i> But this tag contains the artist AND the song name: &quot;artist - song&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Thus searching for lyrics should be possible but the lyrics tab shows
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Artist or song title not set&quot;.
</I>
How is Sonata to know that both the artist and song are in the song
name tag? Is it supposed to assume that a '-' in the song means this?
There's obviously a huge number of situations where that doesn't work
(hyphenated words). Do other clients look for this sort of thing? I
hate to add specific code to work around problems with shoutcast
streams that don't properly set their tags.

Anyway, I have thrown up a new tarball.. please test your issues
(anyone else is welcome to as well ;p).
