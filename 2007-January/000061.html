<PRE>Hy Scott,
I'm definitely willing to rework the patch. I'm going to look into that
later today.
Just two things I noticed while looking at the new song info window:
It is not possible any more to start sonata without installing it,
because ./pixmaps is not a valid path for find_path.
adding something along the lines of
elif os.path.exists(os.path.join(os.path.split(__file__)[0], 'pixmaps',
filename)):
   full_filename = os.path.join(os.path.split(__file__)[0], 'pixmaps',
filename)
fixes this.

The other thing is that the tabs in the song info window are literally
labelled &quot;Song _Info&quot;,
&quot;Cover _Art&quot; and &quot;_Lyrics&quot; instead of having the letter underlined, but
I suspect you already noticed that.
