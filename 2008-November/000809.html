Programmatically speaking, sonata is trying to do too little ;) The library
search is completely unrelated to the library viewing mode (and it predates
it), it simply returns a search of all files in your library. While you came
up with a use case where you wanted a different behavior, it's certainly
easy to come up with the opposite use case. Imagine you're somewhere buried
inside your library and suddenly you want to add a specific file. The last
thing you want is to have to switch library views before searching to get
the result you want.

I'm inclined to keep it the way it is because, in your use case, you have
another option. You could have clicked on the library treeview and started
typing 'tristan' instead. This would use gtk's built-in find-as-you-type
and, since the albums are listed alphabetically, you would've had your three
results right there.


&gt;<i> I know this might be pushing it but an album cover preview would be
</I>&gt;<i> perfect, in place of the generic (though attractive) blue icon. But
</I>&gt;<i> you know that already...
</I>

If I had added it, the album view would've been extremely slow. Cover art
will come, but it'll need to be refactored to be threaded so it can work in
the background - it wasn't coded for getting so many covers at once.
