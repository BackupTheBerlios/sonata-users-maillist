<PRE>Scott,
I'm blown away - many thanks!
This makes a huge difference: a significant improvement in usability.
(As of tonight I default entirely to Sonata).

The only odd thing is the search: so, I'm looking at my albums and I
just want to see those titled &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, I select 'Album'
from the search mode drop down and begin entering 'tristan...' in a
flash I get results (wonderfully responsive), but instead of showing
the albums it shows the songs within those albums. Which means I get a
song list from all three versions of Tristan. Odd, no?
Strictly speaking, the expected behaviour would be to return a result
set based upon the current view.
Further, were I in Artist list view and searched for 'Album'
&quot;tristan&quot;, I would see a list of the three artists in my collection
with Tristan und Isolde recordings. And so on.
In this respect, Sonata is trying to do too much. It needn't.
--
I know this might be pushing it but an album cover preview would be
perfect, in place of the generic (though attractive) blue icon. But
you know that already...
--
I'll enter the composer request tonight.
In general, as far as UI goes, Sonata is easily the best of the single
pane players - fast, intuitive, discrete.
But for a few details, almost perfect.

Again, much thanks - great work.
--Fergus

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The beauty of QL's Album List view, on the other hand, is that it's

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It makes browsing a simple &quot;see it, play it&quot; experience.

</I>&gt;<i> people that just want an album view cutting cross all artists/genres. It's
</I>&gt;<i> been on my todo for a while to bring it back and you finally gave me the
</I>&gt;<i> motivation to work on it today. So do a svn update and try it out. There's
</I>&gt;<i> room for improvement (it doesn't yet show album art as I will need to
</I>&gt;<i> refactor that, and its Various Artists logic isn't as good as the VA logic
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere yet), but it does have some simple logic for lumping together,
</I>&gt;<i> say, classical albums into a single VA album. I also took the liberty of
</I>&gt;<i> making some improvements (IMO) to the other modes, including more details
</I>&gt;<i> and caching.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suggestions welcome. Aside from some of the pending improvements I mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> above, I'm tempted to switch to more contextual information for some of
</I>&gt;<i> these views. For example, under the listing of artists, it'd be nice to say
</I>&gt;<i> the number of albums for each artist - although I'm not sure whether to
</I>&gt;<i> replace the current information with it or add it to the current info.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for handling composer tags, I'd suggest filing a feature request for
</I>&gt;<i> this.
