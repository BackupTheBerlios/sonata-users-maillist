I have to admit that it amazes me a bit, but there was an album mode like
you described in older versions of Sonata. I took it out and replaced it
with another mode that I thought much superior - but clearly there are many
people that just want an album view cutting cross all artists/genres. It's
been on my todo for a while to bring it back and you finally gave me the
motivation to work on it today. So do a svn update and try it out. There's
room for improvement (it doesn't yet show album art as I will need to
refactor that, and its Various Artists logic isn't as good as the VA logic
elsewhere yet), but it does have some simple logic for lumping together,
say, classical albums into a single VA album. I also took the liberty of
making some improvements (IMO) to the other modes, including more details
and caching.

Suggestions welcome. Aside from some of the pending improvements I mentioned
above, I'm tempted to switch to more contextual information for some of
these views. For example, under the listing of artists, it'd be nice to say
the number of albums for each artist - although I'm not sure whether to
replace the current information with it or add it to the current info.

As for handling composer tags, I'd suggest filing a feature request for
this.
