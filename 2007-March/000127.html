<PRE>I was thinking about this some more on the bus ride home from work,
wondering if there might be some sort of algorithm that would make 99%
of people happy. It seems to me that a Various Artists album would
tend to never have more than some maximum number of songs from the
same artist - say 5.

So if we had Song A from Artist A on the Untitled Album.. we would do
a search for all other songs with Untitled Album as the album name. If
these songs span only a single artist, Artist A, it's a simple case.
If instead there are multiple artists, we check to see if there are
more than 5 songs by any artist. If so, it's a good chance that we are
dealing with multiple albums from different artists (i.e. Untitled
Album by Artist A and Untitled Album by Artist B). If not, we assume
this is a single Various Artists album.

Anyway, just wanted to jot down these thoughts.. if anyone else has a
suggestion, feel free to mention it ;-) I'm sure there are other ways
you could structure the algorithm. But I think something along these
lines would be an interesting approach..

Scott
