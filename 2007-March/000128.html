I was thinking of something reallly simple, when selecting album art,
you could add a checkbox (or something) that states &quot;this is a mixed
artist album&quot; and the file would be saved as album.jpg. When looking
for the album art you first check if there is any artist-album.jpg
file, if not, check if there is an album.jpg file if so use that.
Though the downside is you have to set it up manually. :-/

While looking around I found out how BMPx is doing it:
<A HREF="http://forum.beep-media-player.org/viewthread.php?tid=438">http://forum.beep-media-player.org/viewthread.php?tid=438</A>

I'm not sure I like their approach since it again will also lead to
manual work by setting the extra tag up.

Amarok seems to user the same approach as Soanta (but using a hash of
artist-album as name):
<A HREF="http://amarok.kde.org/forum/index.php?topic=11741.msg11871#msg11871">http://amarok.kde.org/forum/index.php?topic=11741.msg11871#msg11871</A>

And they seem to have an internal database that keeps track of VA
albums: <A HREF="http://amarok.kde.org/forum/index.php?topic=10146.0">http://amarok.kde.org/forum/index.php?topic=10146.0</A>

That's what I've found out.. I've never used many players myself (only
XMMS/Audacious) before moving to MPD and Sonata so I don't know many
others.
