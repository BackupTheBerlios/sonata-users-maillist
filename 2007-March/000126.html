I guess I flip-flopped here and forgot my own logic ;-) You're right,
it seems to be inconsistent at the moment. I still have some
uneasiness about using Various Artists merely because the album titles
for two songs match - surely some people have multiple artists with
the same album name (Untitled and Self-Titled might be the most common
examples). Vex, any chance you can check what a couple of other media
players do for songs that have the same album name and different
artists?

If nothing else, I should make the logic consistent between album art
and album info.
