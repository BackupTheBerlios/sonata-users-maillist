<PRE>Hello guys,

My name is Manuel I'm from Rosario, Argentina, I'm an electronics
engineer student, and I also work for AIRcable (www.aircable.net) . I've
been using sonata for about 3 months, and I have to admit WHAT A GREAT
APPLICATION! sonata+mpd creates the perfect remote audio player for my
apartment. At AIRcable we integrated a little box called ebox2300 with a
linux version from a friend of mine from here, an then my friend told me
of mpd, I liked mpd at first, but then when I met sonata I really felt
in love with the solution.

I'm also a big fan of amarok I have to admit, amarok rocks, but sonata
isn't bad either. One of the things I really love about amarok is
shoutcast integration, been able to browse the hole shoutcast server
listing made me fall in love with it.

So as I was a fan of both projects I started to wonder how Amarok
handles shoutcast, once I discovered that I started to try to integrate
shoutcast into sonata, and that's when I noticed something... Sonata
code IS a nightmare, I can't get how you made it to maintain the code
for so long, and made such a great application with such a complex code.
But anyway, as I know how to code, and how hard is to maintain an Open
Source project, I wanna give my piece of sand to the time.

Yesterday taling to tuukkah in the IRC we started talking about a
plugins framework, and I told him I was going to try to implement a
prototype. Well here it is, I present you my plugin framework. The
plugin frameworks uses distutils so we leave distutils all the work
related to dependencies, insertion points and all that. Actually the
hole framework is based on this:

Mhh I know lots of questions will arise from this email, and I have to
admit I'm not a guy who likes to writes long emails, but I will if
needed, check the attached file. This patch has been generated against
svn rev953.

Please let the questions rain fell down over me.

Thanks,
Manuel Naranjo
