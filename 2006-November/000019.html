&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> I just discovered Sonata today and I really like it!  I love its
</I>&gt;<i> intelligent, clean, minimalistic interface. Very nice, well done.
</I>
Thanks :)

&gt;<i> * Preserve aspect ratio when scaling the album art. Not all album art is
</I>&gt;<i>   square.
</I>
I guess I never came across any images that didn't look fine scaled to
a 1:1 aspect ratio, but sure, I'll do it.

* Display the year of release in the popup album art window.

I plan on adding all the various metadata to that popup.. song info,
track length, release date, etc. just haven't gotten around to it yet,
it's on the todo.

</I>&gt;<i> Thinking about this, it should probably check the window state,

</I>
I think that people are more or less split on this. I know that
someone in #mpd just this week requested that gmpc not do this. I
guess I don't really care either way though, I'll look into changing
that. As for looking at the window state, the fact that the
application isn't minimized doesn't mean that the application is
viewable (i.e. other apps can be raised over it, it can be on another
workspace or screen, etc.), so I don't think that's a good idea.

&gt;<i> &gt; * Some sort of play/pause indication in the tray icon would be nice,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   although not really necessary I guess.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is something I've wondered about in general.... Is it possible to
</I>&gt;<i> render multiple stock icons on the fly? Because then the Sonata icon
</I>&gt;<i> could be overlaid with one's GTK+ theme's media icons. That'd be sexy.
</I>
One of the first changes I made to pygmy was to remove the code that
changed the tray icon based on mpd state. I don't see why anyone would
want this - can't you hear if your music is playing or not? Or is
there something I'm missing?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Share cover art with gmpc/pympd (in ~/.covers IIRC)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having been using Banshee primarily, and Rhythmbox before, I'd say
</I>&gt;<i> that even better, Sonata could look up the MusicBrainz IDs and get the
</I>&gt;<i> album art that way. I'm not sure how that's done, only that Banshee/RB
</I>&gt;<i> do that. It's nice; don't have to worry about local picture files. :)
</I>
Gmpc retrieves higher resolution images than Sonata does. I'm not sure
how gmpc uses the cover art, but I'm hesitant to put lower res images
in ~/.covers unless I know it wouldn't negatively affect gmpc. Does
gmpc display images greater than 160x* anywhere? As for what
Banshee/RB do, I much prefer having images fetched and stored locally
for when I have no net connection - it only amounts to a few mb and
reduces bandwidth.

Thanks for the feedback, all.

Scott
