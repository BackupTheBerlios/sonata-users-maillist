<PRE>Hi there. First: fantastic client.

I fell in love of MPD when I knew of it (and knew how to use it), but the
clients, except for ncmpc, always dislike me. With time, GMPC was, but only
in some ways, the only one with a nice front-end and all those nice features
that I think make playing music more colorful.

Sonata freed me of the sometimes painful process of making work the lastest
GMPC version with is plugins.

The concept of no main menu give him a nifty plain look, and the popup is
great.

I have a few suggestions that maybe could help. The principal thing is the
volume. Playing with alsamixer I have wondered long ago why raising
the PCMvolume makes the sound noisy, when the
Master volume dont. Ive noticed that the volume control in Sonata is the PCM
one. Maybe this happen only to me, but I think that it would be better to
have the Master volume controled from there.
The other thing is having an alternative to the progress bar. You'll see,
when I reduce the player width, there is a moment when the bar becomes ugly,
and even the time dissapear. It would be nice to have, maybe the time
displayed on the title bar.
Finally, and I know that you are working on this so this will be only a
confirmation of that =p, metadata, lyrics in a nice separated window, like
the cover art.

Thanks for this fantastic program. Regards.
