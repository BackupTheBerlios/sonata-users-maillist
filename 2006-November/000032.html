This is actually not client-specific, the client merely tells mpd to
raise or lower the volume. I haven't tried it, but I think you just
need to specify mixer_control in your mpd.conf as Master instead of
PCM.

</I>
What I can do here is add two more keys to the 'Format' tab in
preferences - %E for elapsed time and %L for song length, and then you
would be able to have the time in the window title if that is what you
want. Would that suffice? And what do you mean by the bar becomes
ugly? (Yes, the time disappears if it can't fit.)

</I>&gt;<i> the cover art.
</I>
Yup, I have added some more metadata to the song info window in svn
(the window you get when you left-click on the album art). It's not
finalized, but that sort of stuff is on the todo. The only problem
with lyrics is that every lyrics site is very incomplete and it's
often quite hackish to retrieve and parse the lyrics from the websites
(I had a svn revision where I had played around with it).

I'm also struggling with how to allow the user to access all this
extra info. I like the idea of clicking on the album art to get a
window with the additional info, but it doesn't work for the user that
has artwork disabled in their prefs.

Thanks for the kind words and suggestions.

Scott
