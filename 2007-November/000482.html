<PRE>Hi Joey. Note that posting to the list requires signing up.

On Nov 25, 2007 12:39 AM,  &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/sonata-users">sonata-users-bounces at lists.berlios.de</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> * Could the volume control be movable using the arrow keys? (Currently
</I>&gt;<i>   they still scroll the queue when the volume control is selected.)
</I>
This seems really weird - you took the time to open the volume window
with your mouse and now you want to use the keyboard to change the
volume? And there are keyboard shortcuts to control the volume
already. Regardless, it's trivial and implemented in svn.

&gt;<i> * A hotkey to scroll the display to the currently playing track would be
</I>&gt;<i>   useful.
</I>
There is, ctrl-i. I'd look over the list of shortcuts in RightClick &gt;
About &gt; Shortcuts.

&gt;<i> * When it does jump to the currently playing track (when starting to play
</I>&gt;<i>   it), the track tends to be the last one visible in the window. It would
</I>&gt;<i>   be better if it were the first one visible, or were displayed in the
</I>&gt;<i>   middle, so that I can see what will come next.
</I>
I may change the default to this or make it a pref since I get quite a
lot of requests for this. Anyone prefer the current behavior?

&gt;<i> * If I enable the &quot;Play enqueued files on activate&quot; option, it works
</I>&gt;<i>   when I add a single track, but if I add a whole album, it doesn't start
</I>&gt;<i>   playing that.
</I>
I see you filed a feature request for this, thanks.

&gt;<i> * I think the search as you type would work better if it updated the
</I>&gt;<i>   display on each keystroke, rather than after each word. If I only type
</I>&gt;<i>   one word, I find myself sitting there wondering why it's not found
</I>&gt;<i>   anything, when in fact it has not yet searched. (Having some color
</I>&gt;<i>   blindness so not seeing the red of search failure, and being a quod libet
</I>&gt;<i>   user so used to fully incremental search, may contribute to this.
</I>
I'm not sure what you mean. It does update on each keystroke (works
here). As soon as I press the first letter, it immediately starts
filtering. Are you sure it's not just slow on your computer? If you
can tell me how to reproduce this, I'll be happy to try to fix it.
Perhaps file a bug report.

&gt;<i> * My statusbar says &quot;546 hours&quot;, it would be nice if it could break that
</I>&gt;<i>   down into days, weeks, etc. :-)
</I>
Yeah, I'm just lazy ;) I'll do it soon in svn.

&gt;<i> * A count of the number of albums would also be a nice thing to have on
</I>&gt;<i>   the statusbar.
</I>
I'm inclined to keep the statusbar display very clean and simple, sorry.

&gt;<i> * The album icon sometimes flashes when moving between tracks in the same
</I>&gt;<i>   album. It looks like it is unnecessarily erasing and redrawing it.
</I>
That's crazy that you can see a visible refresh. What kind of computer
are you on? Anyway, fixed in svn.

Scott
