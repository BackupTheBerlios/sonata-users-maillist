<PRE>Now it gets a bit complicated. Elegance is Sonata's main strength. Please  
keep it tidy and logical.

Back to the basics, there's two things you might want to do:

(A) You save to an existing playlist -&gt; you append items.

(B) You save to a new playlist -&gt; you make a new one. (If a playlist with  
that name already exists, you're asked to overwrite it, or cancel.)

At this time, it's not consistent to tell the program you want to append  
stuff to that list - it means you've changed your mind. Consequently, it  
is not logical to be offered that option by the program. You have already  
said you want to create a new playlist.

</I>&gt;<i> For what it's worth, in the current version you can &quot;save to&quot; &gt; &quot;new
</I>&gt;<i> playlist&quot;, type in an existing playlist's name, and it will prompt you
</I>&gt;<i> to overwrite it. But I can see how all of this isn't very intuitive. I
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to get the improvement into svn this weekend.
