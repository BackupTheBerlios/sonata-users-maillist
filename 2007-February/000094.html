<PRE>Hi!

I have various artist albums. Whenever I change my library view to &quot;artists&quot;
I see many artists with only one or two songs in my library. I would really
only like to see artists that have full albums in that view. I think it
would be much better if all albums with more than one contributing artist
were categorized under &quot;various artists&quot; or something similar to that.

I realize that this might cause problems when there are different albums
named the same. One solution to this might be to check the paths, as often
albums are stored in separate directories. If two artists each have an album
of the same title, Sonata might check the paths of the albums to see what to
do. (That may not be explained very clearly, sorry). Another solution might
be to add a &quot;do not show this album under various artists&quot; entry to the
library's right-click context menu. I suspect that it would be very rare for
two albums to have the same name, so the latter solution might be better.

Thanks!
Jon Temple
