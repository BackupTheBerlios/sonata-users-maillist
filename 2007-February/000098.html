<PRE>Hello!

(I hope that this message is fitting, appropriate, and
submitted correctly.)

I happened to find this project through a Google
search and I have to say that it could be exactly what
I'm looking for.  Previously, I made heavy use of
Winamp in conjunction with Windows Explorer, and then
I got by with Totem although it seemed a little
awkward.  I like the concept of Rhythmbox and Banshee,
but such library/metafile-based systems seem as though
they have a few kinks to work out, as it seems to add
a layer of complexity as opposed to making things
simpler.

For example, I have a bunch of Orbital music files
from different albums in a particular folder.  It
makes sense on the disk, and in my head, but if you
index the directory with Rhythmbox, it paints a pretty
confusing picture.  I'm sure that there's a way to
make it all work out, such as with saved playlists or
something like that, but I feel as though Banshee
would explode if I added my entire CD collection to
the library (too many songs to load in one view).

Still, I'd like to try additional modern media players
out before defaulting to something like Winamp (e.g.;
Beep Media Player), so I'm looking forward to trying
Sonata out.  From the screen shots, I can say that I
like the simple display, file editing capabilities,
library/file browser method and little nice things
like the tooltip (of which I'm a fan with Banshee). 
Furthermore this is the first that I've heard of MPD,
and I will have to read more about that.

I was wondering, though; That looks like a very nice
theme (GTK?) used in the screen shots.  May I ask what
it is?  Also, I was checking the currency of this
project, so I looked on the changelog page.  At first,
I was disappointed slightly, but then I noticed that
the version jumps from 0.9 in November 19, 2006 to 1.0
on January 21, 2006 (which should read &quot;2007&quot;). 
That's what I call progress!  ;-)

At any rate, I'm going to be trying this, Listen,
Songbird, and probably a few others.  I just looked at
Exaile, and it seems nice, but it'll take me a while
to figure out what seems to be working for me.  Not
being bound to a particular desktop environment is a
plus, as I'm not certain that I'll be sticking with
GNOME.  I thank you for presenting a viable solution
for those of us that are looking for *just the right*
media player.  

Cheers!
