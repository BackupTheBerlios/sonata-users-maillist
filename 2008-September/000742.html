Seems to work fine here Scott- nice work. Not too slow over a wireless
connection at least. I thought at first I found a bug with some songs
being returned twice, but I think my library just needed an update as
I can't reproduce it after I did that. Figured I'd mention it thouugh
just in case anyone else saw the same and was too timid to speak up.

While testing, I did come across a much more severe issue- a long
playlist + slow Eee processor + network connection = trouble when
adding a single song searched via the above addition. I would guess
our culprit lies in one of the many for loops in here:

    def library_get_recursive_filenames(self, return_root):

It takes 3 or 4 seconds to add a single song at 100% processor usage
for my 4100 song playlist- you can see it just grinding away. This is
on the client side too- I don't think it is server related as a remote
ncmpc connection works absolutely fine doing the same add.
