<PRE>Hi all,

I wanted to talk a little bit about where sonata stands and where it's
hopefully going. Many of you have probably noticed that development has
slowed down quite a bit - due to the nice summer weather, a full time job,
and a personal level of satisfaction with the current state of sonata. I
imagine that my time on sonata may pick up a little during the winter, but I
doubt it'll ever be again at the level where it has been in the past.

With that said, I'm hoping to encourage others that may want to get involved
by providing some direction. I've been lucky enough to get some great
community support with all the patches and so on, and hopefully that can
continue in a more directed manner. I've been sitting on some patches of
interesting features for a while (e.g. dynamic playlists) and I imagine that
the development of other features could be better facilitated. Towing the
line between functional and lightweight can be difficult.

So, what I'd really like to see for the next major sonata release is a
plugin system [1]. Aside from being able to better handle features I
wouldn't consider core, it would make sonata a much lighter application for
those that want it more stripped down. For example, dbus-python, which is
really only used to make sonata a single instance app and enable some
(obsoleted?) multimedia key support, adds a decent amount to both sonata ram
usage and startup time. Some current features could also move to plugins -
lyrics, artwork, audioscrobbler support, tag editing, etc.

Unfortunately, 1) sonata hasn't been designed for a plugin system, 2) I
don't know the first thing about it, and 3) I have limited time these days.
I'm hoping to find an individual (or three) that might like to collaborate
on this. Clearly there are people on the list with programming experience
(probably better than me, I'm just an engineer) and an interest in sonata's
future. So if you're at all interested, please reply here or email me
privately.

Scott

[1] I should point out that I really hate plugin systems where you have a
separate package for each plugin; I'd much prefer to distribute as many
plugins as possible with a simple enable/disable dialog (and plugin
preferences).
