Hi Scott,

Sounds really good! I'm a guy who'd use xmms if it wasn't for mpd and sonata (and ncmpc, of course..) and as for any other apps, the firs thing I do is that I strip them down to the base minimum right after first install, possibly later enabling some features I find useful. So the whole idea of a plugin based sonata would be more than welcome!

Just some thoughts about the core and the things built in. Have you had any further thoughts what it would consist of? I think it should provide nothing more and nothing less but a basic frontend for mpd, or to be exact, a GUI for python-mpd (..it's only my assumption that python-mpd is the thing how sonata interacts with mpd, please correct me if I'm wrong). All the rest would then be installed when needed, as plugins.

One thing I'd also find.. well nice, would be some sort of themeing support. I remember it's been discussed earlier at some point, but I'm not sure how it ended up? A possibility for icon themes would be a start, I probably wouldn't change the look more than that anyhow, except when changing my desktop wide theme. But I also know some people would find themes attracting. So a thing like: no theme = default gtk theme, no icon_theme = default gtk icon theme. ..and then again one could override the default looks by installing proper files to, say ~/.config/sonata/themes.

For the plugin's distribution, I agree with the all-in-one thought, I think it won't make sonata that big in size so it would be a problem! However, if it ever looks like there would be too many &quot;not sure if this really is useful&quot; things coming along, it's always possible to make some sort of an extra-plugins-pack, but I guess this won't happen in a while, at least not tomorrow.

Anyhow, I'm looking forward to how the development continues from now on. Today, sonata is a stable, solid and a feature rich app which I doubt I'd ever exchange to any other GUI mpd fronted even if it's active development stopped right now.

Cheers,
Sakari
