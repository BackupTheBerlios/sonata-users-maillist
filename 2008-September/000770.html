<PRE>Hi,
I wrote the first version of this. It is very limited now and I can
think of many improvements, but anyway it's working on my computer
(because my library is placed on the same place as Sonata).
The worse thing about how I wrote this is the way I'm getting the file
path based on the TreeView selection. I'm not familiar with Sonata
source code, so I solved it by getting the song's title from the
TreeView, and then by going through the library and comparing this
title with every song. I bet this could be done in more efficient way
:<i>)  On the other hand, this does not feel slow, and this code is
</I>executed only when DND is being performed, so this won't cause Sonata
to be less responsive, I think.
(the other problem is that current song's title is in bold, so I had
to strip the &quot;&lt;b&gt;&quot; tags).

And, of course, this is working only on localhost, but probably it can
be done via FTP/SSHFS/NFS, especially now, when Gnome is using GVFS.

Oh, and this is the patch against SVN version of Sonata.
