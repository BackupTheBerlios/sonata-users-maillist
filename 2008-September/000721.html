<PRE>I think sonata is great as is, but the plugin idea could be a good step
(although I, like you, dislike separate plugin packages).
The only thing I ever missed from Sonata (which GMPC has) is the ability to
make a random playlist. Aside from that the app is perfect :D

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wanted to talk a little bit about where sonata stands and where it's
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully going. Many of you have probably noticed that development has
</I>&gt;<i> slowed down quite a bit - due to the nice summer weather, a full time job,
</I>&gt;<i> and a personal level of satisfaction with the current state of sonata. I
</I>&gt;<i> imagine that my time on sonata may pick up a little during the winter, but I
</I>&gt;<i> doubt it'll ever be again at the level where it has been in the past.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that said, I'm hoping to encourage others that may want to get
</I>&gt;<i> involved by providing some direction. I've been lucky enough to get some
</I>&gt;<i> great community support with all the patches and so on, and hopefully that
</I>&gt;<i> can continue in a more directed manner. I've been sitting on some patches of
</I>&gt;<i> interesting features for a while (e.g. dynamic playlists) and I imagine that
</I>&gt;<i> the development of other features could be better facilitated. Towing the
</I>&gt;<i> line between functional and lightweight can be difficult.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, what I'd really like to see for the next major sonata release is a
</I>&gt;<i> plugin system [1]. Aside from being able to better handle features I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't consider core, it would make sonata a much lighter application for
</I>&gt;<i> those that want it more stripped down. For example, dbus-python, which is
</I>&gt;<i> really only used to make sonata a single instance app and enable some
</I>&gt;<i> (obsoleted?) multimedia key support, adds a decent amount to both sonata ram
</I>&gt;<i> usage and startup time. Some current features could also move to plugins -
</I>&gt;<i> lyrics, artwork, audioscrobbler support, tag editing, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, 1) sonata hasn't been designed for a plugin system, 2) I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know the first thing about it, and 3) I have limited time these days.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hoping to find an individual (or three) that might like to collaborate
</I>&gt;<i> on this. Clearly there are people on the list with programming experience
</I>&gt;<i> (probably better than me, I'm just an engineer) and an interest in sonata's
</I>&gt;<i> future. So if you're at all interested, please reply here or email me
</I>&gt;<i> privately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1] I should point out that I really hate plugin systems where you have a
</I>&gt;<i> separate package for each plugin; I'd much prefer to distribute as many
</I>&gt;<i> plugins as possible with a simple enable/disable dialog (and plugin
</I>&gt;<i> preferences).
