Thanks for testing. I'll keep an eye out for that, if it's a bug.

It's definitely not a problem with that routine, since it won't be doing any
recursion in the case of adding a single song (the recursion is for drilling
down when, say, adding the collection of an artist or a directory). The
slowdown all essentially happens in the current_update routine when we
retrieve the current playlist upon noticing that there was a change in the
playlist. It's easy to pinpoint with a few print statements.

And I had written up a bunch of stuff about how python-mpd is faster than
the previous mpdclient2 interface but still not very fast blah blah blah,
until I looked back over the mpd commands and realized there is a command to
retrieve only changes in the current playlist. I'd seen it in the past, but
always thought it had to do with saved playlists, not the current one, based
on its name. I'm going to play with this over the weekend, but I expect that
using this will drastically speed up adding to a large playlist (although
not adding a ton of songs to the playlist at once, of course). Man do I feel
stupid. Ah well, better late than never. In my defense, I don't think pygmy
ever used it either :P

Rarely having a playlist over 100 songs,
Scott
