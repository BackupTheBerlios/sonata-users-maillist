&gt;<i> Hello everybody,
</I>&gt;<i> I was some time without internet, and I could not follow the discussion, but reading through the posts I think there was no conclusion made yet. But I think we sould address in some way the issue for which was all the discussion started. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the moment when browsing the library and double clicking the song, it gets added to current playlist, but there is no notification to user, and I have seen several people already (my visitors who do not know Sonata) saying &quot;It doesn work&quot;, because they did not here the song they have clicked on nor have seen it added to playlist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for myself, I run Sonata quite large, so I would be in favour of a second panel appearing when searchnig the library, viewing song info and selecting playlists, and disappearing when the action is done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a matter of fact, I have tried to run two instances of Sonata to &quot;emulate&quot; this behavior, and I did like the result quite a bit. It is much more obvious what is happening. And being able to drag n drop the song from library to a certaing position in playlist would be a big step forward from my point of view.. (note that I am not talking about having two panels always visible, I do not like this either)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would maybe changing the fonts to smaller ones help the people who like to run Sonata narrow?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is the opinion of the You people who like to run Sonata narrow?
</I>
I don't think that changing the font size will achieve anything. It's perfectly readable at the resolution I run, and making it smaller will negatively effect that without gaining anything.

There is certainly some merit to being able to add files to the playlist where you want them, as opposed to just the end of the list.

Some people really like the drag and drop metaphor, but you have to be able to see your drop location, and that takes screen space. The only exception that I've discovered while looking into this was a file manager that used an icon as a kind of a clipboard called a &quot;drop stack&quot;. The idea was that you could drag files from one location into this drop stack -- which is just an icon -- and then once got done grabbing files, you change to the new location and drag the stack (by grabbing the icon) where you want it. It's kind of an interesting concept.

So far as double-clicking files goes, I see options in various applications pertaining to what happens when you click a file. This seems to come down to two things: play/run the file, or queue it. Sonata's behavior is to queue, and obviously Tomas' testers were expecting the other.

I don't have a clear sense that one technique is better than another. I do think that there probably ways to achieve everything in a manner that plays to Sonata's strengths, without alienating or disappointing one side or the other. (Presuming there are only two sides.)
