Yes... but if that's all you can do with the sidebar, you deny that
functionality to users that don't want to use it in that way. In Firefox, you
can use the sidebars, slide them to nothing (as you suggest above), or open
them in separate windows.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it important to SEE the adds from Library taking place if you know exactly

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is important because people need feedback to confirm their 
</I>&gt;<i> actions.
</I>
If there was a marker point set in the Current tab so that whatever you DnD
goes there, you could set the tab label to bold as a visual queue that the DnD
was successful. I'm not lobbying for this, just pointing out that feedback
does not necessarily mean showing users every step of what they just did.


&gt;<i> &gt; The xplorer2 file manager uses an interesting model that might give us some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ideas. It's a two pane file manager, and you can open directories in tabs in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both panes. The nice thing about the functionality is that unlike the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nautilus implementation of tabbed file management, you can DnD files onto a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tab. (Nautilus simply switches to the tab and forces you to drop your files in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the directory window.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting indeed. The plus is that DnD provides feedback. However, 
</I>&gt;<i> the minus is that DnD is slow compared to the fact that in Sonata, 
</I>&gt;<i> you can achieve the same with a simple double click.
</I>
Think of traditional FTP clients. Two panels and a set of directional move
buttons. You can DnD between panels, but the process can take so long that
visual feedback is essentially nil. I'm obviously in a minority (or completely
in the dark) but I always thought DnD was a convenience for me to select
things and do an action to them without having to select things and then look
for and move to a button to do said action.

I guess I have more faith in the intelligence of users than to think they have
to see something as simple as adding an mp3 to a list. Barnum said that &quot;no
one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public&quot;,
and there's something to that, but I question whether or not the absolute need
to visualize a DnD applies to a user base that has managed to get mpd
installed and configured.  *g*


&gt;<i> &gt; If it was possible to set a &quot;marker&quot; in the Current list, then the DnD on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Current tab could drop the files at that location. (ALT-click might be a good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea, since it's not used; and it should probably set a different color
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; highlight than normal left-clicks.) And if there's no marker, the add is just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the bottom of the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This applies as much to the current double-click adds (as you 
</I>&gt;<i> pointed out below). A simpler variation might be to make the marker 
</I>&gt;<i> an always-present entry in the Current list, and you could move it 
</I>&gt;<i> via DnD and whatever tools we have for playlist reordering.
</I>
I don't mind DnD if it's in visible window space, but every time I have to DnD
and scroll the window contents, I wonder why no one's come up with a more
efficient way of making that work. Having to DnD across a list of several
thousand entries would inspire me to floss with own intestines.

I like your idea of putting the marker in the sort controls. (Though you might
have to rename the menu entry to &quot;Manage List&quot; instead of &quot;Sort List&quot;.)

I'm wondering -- because I don't see a setting that controls this -- why Dan's
large icon album view just displays names (spatially inefficient), and mine
fills the space by including stats for number of songs and run time?

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; covers a great deal of the main window -- which now means you have to

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have to ask why and how narrow do you need to keep the window? The 
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox sidebar doesn't have to be that wide to show browsing 
</I>&gt;<i> history or bookmarks.
</I>
My Firefox window? I keep that about 1400px wide. That's about the max width
for pages to look decent. (Particularly dynamic width CSS pages.) In order for
the sidebar to be useful/legible, it has to be about 30% of the window, and
that cuts my window down to ~800px, and that means that pretty much every page
requires horizontal scrolling. So either I'm adjusting the size of the main
window to make it readable, or I'm adjusting the sidebar to make it useful.
Why bother? The Library has a separate window that includes ALL info for
bookmarks and history, and not the abbreviated subset you get in the sidebar.
I actually run the Library bigger than the main Firefox window, and since one
sits over top of the other, they don't compete for screen space.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; What if the library tab was placed above the current tab instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to the left or the right? IOW, there would be a vertically split window
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; instead of a horizontally split window. This would allow the narrow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; width users to keep their narrow windows. The only issue here is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; users might need a very tall window. But I imagine the library tab
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; would slide out when it is needed and hidden at other times.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Aren't practically all screens and windows more wide than tall? The 
</I>&gt;<i> slide out wouldn't help much as library browsing is the demanding 
</I>&gt;<i> task here.
</I>
I tend to run most things square-ish, except for two-pane things like file
managers which I generally set so that each pane is square-ish.

That's the nice thing about 16:9 monitors. They lend themselves to square
apps, with an open side space to tuck tall, skinny apps in. On Linux, that's
things like Conky and Sonata. On Windows, it's Rainmeter and Winamp and some
icons.

The only apps I use that lend themselves to full screen are design apps where
you want to have access to every available pixel.


&gt;<i> &gt; Tear-off, or separate windows are good, because assumably you'd open
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one, do whatever you were going to do, and then close it once you're done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This similar to the typical design of putting the Library in a 
</I>&gt;<i> dialog window.
</I>
Is it? I'm not familiar with the terminology.


&gt;<i> To keep playing music, you can even quit Sonata. I mentioned the 
</I>&gt;<i> other features we have to fulfil this concern above.
</I>
But I must have CONTROL!!!!!!!  *g*


&gt;<i> &gt; Here's a question: can tabs also be buttons? If so, middle-clicking a tab
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could open it in a separate window, which means people could drag things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; between windows, then close the child window. It would be even cooler if that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; click could act as a show/hide toggle; you wouldn't need window decoration,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and your mousing could be more efficient since you control it from the main
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; window, which is where you control all the other parts of Sonata.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would be possible indeed, but doesn't sound conventional, clean 
</I>&gt;<i> or easy to use.
</I>
It's conventional in Firefox. There are all kinds of extensions that use
buttons to toggle things open and shut. Sometimes those things are part of the
main UI, and sometimes they're separate windows.
