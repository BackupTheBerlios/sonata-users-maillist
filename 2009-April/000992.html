If you guys don't mind, I wanted to throw a few of my thoughts out
there. Unfortunately there aren't too many actionable ideas, but I
hope you keep some of my thoughts in mind.

First, if Sonata ever becomes unusable here:
<A HREF="http://www.toofishes.net/media/extra/Arch_on_Eee_Feb_2008.png">http://www.toofishes.net/media/extra/Arch_on_Eee_Feb_2008.png</A>
you will lose me, and I would guess others, as a user. So keeping the
interface minimal is a huge plus, both horizontally and vertically.

Second, I don't mind the new breadcrumb view at all, as long as some
of the concerns you mentioned are met and it hopefully gains back the
minimalism of the old view. Here is a screenshot of SVN 1152 and
released version 1.5.3 side by side:

Notice how I can see only half as many folders in the new
implementation. I really like the navigation at the top, but increased
size is not something I am a fan of. Of course, I refresh it now and
things are showing up as folder logos, but still larger, so I'm not
completely sure what is going on.

I wanted to at least chime in here to make a point- some of us *do*
appreciate the KISS-ness of Sonata, and it would be sad to get away
from that. I enjoy the fact that my music player window does not take
up more than a small portion of my screen. Remember that the whole
world is not running a Gnome desktop.
