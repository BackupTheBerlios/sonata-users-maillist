I'm not a fan of the Firefox sidebar. In order for it to be really useful --
to keep you from having to constantly scroll left/right to read things and see
what's going on -- you have to keep it set wide. And if it's set wide, then it
covers a great deal of the main window -- which now means you have to resize that.

There is a Firefox extension that I used to use that allowed the sidebar to be
torn off the main window, into its own separate window. Tuukkah mentions
something similar, below.


&gt;<i> Anyway, I agree we want to keep Sonata clean and find the simplest 
</I>&gt;<i> thing that works. After half a year I still belong to the group of 
</I>&gt;<i> people for whom the current interface for adding doesn't work intuitively.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [some details removed]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One could search the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; library and drag the files to current playlist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, although I'm not sure exactly how important drag and drop is 
</I>&gt;<i> here. The main goals would be for people to somehow
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * see the adds from Library actually taking place,
</I>&gt;<i> * grasp where the songs appear as a result, and
</I>&gt;<i> * have a one-click way to clear the playlist.
</I>
Is it important to SEE the adds from Library taking place if you know exactly
where they're going?

We don't have a one-click way to clear the playlist now. Has this been a problem?


&gt;<i> DnD would enable &quot;clickless&quot; adds and reordering while adding, but 
</I>&gt;<i> on the other hand, it would be slower than the double-clicks.
</I>
That's true, but presumably DnD would augment and not replace double-clicking,
right?


&gt;<i> Now that I think about it, the main goals could be achieved via 
</I>&gt;<i> other designs as well, such as
</I>&gt;<i> * opening the Library and Current tabs in separate windows,
</I>&gt;<i> * opening the Library tab as a dialog window from the Current tab
</I>&gt;<i>   (a typical design in other apps, I see)
</I>&gt;<i> * adding a checkmark or playlist number column to the Library view.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But these are all less clear, am I right?
</I>
The last two certainly seem so. Opening the Library tab in a separate window
would be akin to having a file manager window and being able to drag files out
of it and into a playlist. You can do this with most media players, and I see
on the ToDo list that Sonata will eventually support this.


&gt;<i> &gt; Clicking Playlists
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would replace the Library panel with the Playlist one, and so on with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Song info tab.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One issue I see here is whether changing the sidebar size in one tab 
</I>&gt;<i> should change it in the other ones as well. The Song Info tab is 
</I>&gt;<i> very different in function from the Library, Playlists, and Streams, 
</I>&gt;<i> which as a group are very similar. But I can still see how a Current 
</I>&gt;<i> sidebar might be nice in the Info tab as well (on the left).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Clicking Active playlist or little cross on top of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side panel (like Firefox sidebar has) would get back to one panel view
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with Active playlist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that the tab interface would be enough. In addition,
</I>&gt;<i>  here it sounds like your idea is to have the other tabs in the 
</I>&gt;<i> sidebar, whereas I think it makes more sense to have the Current tab 
</I>&gt;<i> in the sidebar. I understand Playlists and Streams are quite narrow, 
</I>&gt;<i> but Library and Info not so much.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see Sonata isn't the only music player with this design problem. 
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone seen a nice design in some of the other apps out there? 
</I>
The xplorer2 file manager uses an interesting model that might give us some
ideas. It's a two pane file manager, and you can open directories in tabs in
both panes. The nice thing about the functionality is that unlike the new
Nautilus implementation of tabbed file management, you can DnD files onto a
tab. (Nautilus simply switches to the tab and forces you to drop your files in
the directory window.)

DnD just switching to the Current tab and then requiring you to scroll the
list to find your drop spot may be fine with short lists, but if you have a
huge list (some of the screenshots on the Sonata website show thousands of
songs in the list), it's just impractical.

Directories, obviously, are automatically sorted, so there's no need to drop
things in a specific spot in a list, as you would with a playlist. (Except in
the Nautilus implementation where you might have to scroll past a list of
directories.) It seems that there might be an easy way of handing this issue
in the Sonata UI.

If it was possible to set a &quot;marker&quot; in the Current list, then the DnD on the
Current tab could drop the files at that location. (ALT-click might be a good
idea, since it's not used; and it should probably set a different color
highlight than normal left-clicks.) And if there's no marker, the add is just
to the bottom of the list.

This marker system would allow you to quickly scroll through your Current list
to see where you want the new files to be dropped, and then mark it. It could
also be used in conjunction with the current double-click or right-click+Add
functionality.

There could be an option to automatically switch to the Current tab after a
DnD operation, since some people might want to then do some further
rearranging of their list.

Anyone think that any of that might be suitable to Sonata?
