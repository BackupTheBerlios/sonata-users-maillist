I have to admit I never use the Firefox sidebars and didn't think about 
them here, but they look similar indeed. The difference would be that in 
Firefox you choose items in the sidebar, here you would choose items in 
the main application area. (Would this warrant moving the Current 
sidebar to the right side?)

I was initially thinking more along the lines of moving the Current tab 
out of the tab area and to its left side, but I think your take sounds 
better.

Anyway, I agree we want to keep Sonata clean and find the simplest thing 
that works. After half a year I still belong to the group of people for 
whom the current interface for adding doesn't work intuitively.

[some details removed]
&gt;<i> One could search the
</I>&gt;<i> library and drag the files to current playlist. 
</I>
Yes, although I'm not sure exactly how important drag and drop is here. 
The main goals would be for people to somehow

* see the adds from Library actually taking place,
* grasp where the songs appear as a result, and
* have a one-click way to clear the playlist.

DnD would enable &quot;clickless&quot; adds and reordering while adding, but on 
the other hand, it would be slower than the double-clicks.

Now that I think about it, the main goals could be achieved via other 
designs as well, such as
* opening the Library and Current tabs in separate windows,
* opening the Library tab as a dialog window from the Current tab (a 
typical design in other apps, I see)
* adding a checkmark or playlist number column to the Library view.

But these are all less clear, am I right?

&gt;<i> Clicking Playlists
</I>&gt;<i> would replace the Library panel with the Playlist one, and so on with
</I>&gt;<i> Song info tab. 
</I>
One issue I see here is whether changing the sidebar size in one tab 
should change it in the other ones as well. The Song Info tab is very 
different in function from the Library, Playlists, and Streams, which as 
a group are very similar. But I can still see how a Current sidebar 
might be nice in the Info tab as well (on the left).

&gt;<i> Clicking Active playlist or little cross on top of the
</I>&gt;<i> side panel (like Firefox sidebar has) would get back to one panel view
</I>&gt;<i> with Active playlist.
</I>
It seems to me that the tab interface would be enough. In addition, here 
it sounds like your idea is to have the other tabs in the sidebar, 
whereas I think it makes more sense to have the Current tab in the 
sidebar. I understand Playlists and Streams are quite narrow, but 
Library and Info not so much.


I see Sonata isn't the only music player with this design problem. Has 
anyone seen a nice design in some of the other apps out there?
