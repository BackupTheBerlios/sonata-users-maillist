 &gt; you will lose me, and I would guess others, as a user. So keeping the
 &gt; interface minimal is a huge plus, both horizontally and vertically.

So what's your screen width and height in pixels and millimetres/inches? 
  I'm thankful for all input, even though there always are conflicting 
requirements.

I normally run Sonata on a standard 1024x768 14.1&quot; screen and on a 
mobile 800x480 4.1&quot; screen.

 &gt; Here is a screenshot of SVN 1152 and
 &gt; released version 1.5.3 side by side:
 &gt; <A HREF="http://www.toofishes.net/uploads/sonata_library_view.png">http://www.toofishes.net/uploads/sonata_library_view.png</A>
 &gt;
 &gt; Notice how I can see only half as many folders in the new
 &gt; implementation.

This isn't related to breadcrumbs per se, but to another recent change. 
Scott, was the change of the icon size intentional?

 &gt; I enjoy the fact that my music player window does not take
 &gt; up more than a small portion of my screen. Remember that the whole
 &gt; world is not running a Gnome desktop.

Can you expand on this a bit? If you run Sonata on a small device, why 
don't you use the full screen space when navigating the library? For 
background use, we have the collapsed mode, the tray icon and the popup 
notifications. Also, window managers provide maximised and fullscreen 
modes for intermittent space increase.

I have to ask why and how narrow do you need to keep the window? The 
Firefox sidebar doesn't have to be that wide to show browsing history or 
bookmarks.

&gt;&gt;<i> What if the library tab was placed above the current tab instead of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead of a horizontally split window. This would allow the narrow

</I>
Aren't practically all screens and windows more wide than tall? The 
slide out wouldn't help much as library browsing is the demanding task here.

&gt;<i> Sonata, in its current form, makes very efficient use of its vertical space.
</I>
Yup, vertical space is scarce.

&gt;<i> Tear-off, or separate windows are good, because assumably you'd open
</I>&gt;<i> one, do whatever you were going to do, and then close it once you're done.
</I>
This similar to the typical design of putting the Library in a dialog 
window.

&gt;<i> If anything, my thinking is geared towards finding a less complex solution. I
</I>&gt;<i> probably spend &lt;2% of my Sonata use time loading things to listen to; the
</I>&gt;<i> other &gt;98%, it just sits there playing and making me happy -- so I need the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality, but I don't require it to be a major component of the UI. YMMV.
</I>
To keep playing music, you can even quit Sonata. I mentioned the other 
features we have to fulfil this concern above.

&gt;<i> Here's a question: can tabs also be buttons? If so, middle-clicking a tab
</I>&gt;<i> could open it in a separate window, which means people could drag things
</I>&gt;<i> between windows, then close the child window. It would be even cooler if that
</I>&gt;<i> click could act as a show/hide toggle; you wouldn't need window decoration,
</I>&gt;<i> and your mousing could be more efficient since you control it from the main
</I>&gt;<i> window, which is where you control all the other parts of Sonata.
</I>
This would be possible indeed, but doesn't sound conventional, clean or 
easy to use.
