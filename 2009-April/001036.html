<PRE>Hello everybody,
I was some time without internet, and I could not follow the discussion, but
reading through the posts I think there was no conclusion made yet. But I
think we sould address in some way the issue for which was all the
discussion started.

At the moment when browsing the library and double clicking the song, it
gets added to current playlist, but there is no notification to user, and I
have seen several people already (my visitors who do not know Sonata) saying
&quot;It doesn work&quot;, because they did not here the song they have clicked on nor
have seen it added to playlist.

As for myself, I run Sonata quite large, so I would be in favour of a second
panel appearing when searchnig the library, viewing song info and selecting
playlists, and disappearing when the action is done.

As a matter of fact, I have tried to run two instances of Sonata to
&quot;emulate&quot; this behavior, and I did like the result quite a bit. It is much
more obvious what is happening. And being able to drag n drop the song from
library to a certaing position in playlist would be a big step forward from
my point of view.. (note that I am not talking about having two panels
always visible, I do not like this either)

Would maybe changing the fonts to smaller ones help the people who like to
run Sonata narrow?

What is the opinion of the You people who like to run Sonata narrow?

I made some screenshots from my experiment, I will send them in next post,
as images need to be approved..

With greetings

Tomas

P.S.
I have tried to &quot;emulate&quot; splitting the window vertically as well, but I did
not like this much, because as the new songs appear on the bottom, the
addition was not noticible either..
