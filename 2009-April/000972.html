<PRE>Hello Michael,
only a thought of the album view. Did You notice that You can
customize the library view in preferences? I choose the first field to
be album, and I get the results sorted by album. I think that would
help a little bit.

Only a side note. Have You consideres to group some results together?
I mean &quot;o&quot; and &quot;&#243;&quot; for example. That pressing &quot;o&quot; would give results
for &quot;o&quot; and &quot;&#243;&quot; and pressing &quot;&#243;&quot; the same. In this way one typing
&quot;camaron&quot; or &quot;camar&#243;n&quot; would get the same results of all the MP3 of
this artists (and this is what he/she was probably looking for)

P.S.
For those that would want to tell me that I should keep my library
consistent. One cannot do this when using Sonata as a client on
sombody elses computer, or a public computer.

Tomas

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm sort of confused about the way that the search function works in the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that contain the typed string -- and that makes sense. But it's not going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to give individual results for &quot;antonio&quot; and &quot;molina&quot; if you type &quot;antonio
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> molina&quot;, only that string as a complete entity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the Library tab, typing only jumps to the first hit from the first
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> character, and moves on sequentially from there. So if I hit &quot;s&quot;, I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get everything with an &quot;s&quot;, I jump to the first hit that BEGINS with &quot;s&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the next character I type better match something in the esses, or the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> search is done. It would be really nice if search in the Library tab
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worked like it does in the Current. I think this is what Tomas is asking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for, but I'm confused by Scott's answer. Is Sonata already supposed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behave like this?&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You're confusing the built-in gtk find-as-you-type (if a gtk treeview has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> focus and you start typing, it matches like you described above) with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> library searching that is performed when you type in the search entry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> below the treeview. I assume Tomas was referring to the latter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For the current tab, we override the built-in gtk find-as-you-type to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide a more functional filtering capability. Indeed this could be done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the library tab as well, but it isn't currently. I'd be worried about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the two capabilities conflicting and being confusing to the user, but I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agree it's already an imperfect state.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I recently had this conversation with someone (I thought it was you?). In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any case, that's where we stand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was me, in response to my suggestion that the search function should be
</I>&gt;<i> the same on both tabs. Thought I'd chime in here and see if I couldn't learn
</I>&gt;<i> something about the way Sonata does its thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see now what you were saying in response to Tomas' question. The search
</I>&gt;<i> results do behave fine with spaces. However, I don't understand the logic
</I>&gt;<i> behind the way that Sonata returns results. Using the search entry box, no
</I>&gt;<i> matter what you search for, you get files as a result. And I guess that's
</I>&gt;<i> where my thinking goes all pear shaped. If I use the gtk find-as-you-type
</I>&gt;<i> feature, I can (clumsily) search for an artist/album (because I keep my
</I>&gt;<i> directory structure organized that way). But if I use the Album selector and
</I>&gt;<i> the search box -- which does a nice fuzzy search -- I get a blizzard of
</I>&gt;<i> individual files as a result. They're not organized in a way that I can
</I>&gt;<i> sort, and in order to make any sense of what I'm looking at, I have to hover
</I>&gt;<i> each result. (The tooltip is quite handy in this regard.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining, it just doesn't compute in my
</I>&gt;<i> head. If I search for albums, I expect a list of matching albums as a
</I>&gt;<i> result. Not the contents thereof.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (As a kind of side note, if you get files as the result of a search, it
</I>&gt;<i> would be a cool feature to be able to add the entire album that a file comes
</I>&gt;<i> from to the playlist. You can do something similar from the different view
</I>&gt;<i> dropdowns now, as default behavior of the view. But it would be cool to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to do it from search results.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought Tomas was onto something similar with his initial question. But I
</I>&gt;<i> see now, I was misinterpreting said question. Thanks for clarifying.
