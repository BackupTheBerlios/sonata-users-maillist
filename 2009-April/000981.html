<PRE>
First off, credit where it's due. Tuukkah did an amazing job putting a
breadcrumb navigation system together in really short order. Congrats!

In playing with the thing, there's great merit in the new navigation, but
there are some issues with crumbs rather quickly overrunning the narrow width
Sonata window I run.

Stonecrest suggested that the breadcrumb model used in the gtk open dialogue
box (or a Thunar or Nautilus window) offers a good example of what might be
done to solve the width issue. In playing around with that, and looking at how
I run Sonata, I had some thoughts that I wanted to put forth, and let rest of
the list pick at them...

The problem, as I see it, with the gtk breadcrumb system is that the crumbs,
themselves, do not scale. If there's not enough room to display an entire
crumb, you get no crumb at all. If you have a really long current crumb, it
can knock all the preceding crumbs out of view, and if the current crumb is
too long to be displayed in its entirety, you can wind up with no crumbs at
all, since the contents of the crumbs don't scale down.

Those issues provide suggestions as how Sonata could behave.

The current Sonata layout has the &quot;Views&quot; and view-type buttons on the same
row as the breadcrumbs. That makes sense, in terms of keeping relevant info in
the same place, but further truncates the space available for crumbs. (This
whole issue of horizontal space and line length issue really only pertains to
using the File System view, anyway.)

So the navigation line should always contain &quot;Views&quot; &quot;File System&quot; and however
many breadcrumbs get you to where you are.

Cheesy text mock-up like so:
	VIEWS FILE_SYSTEM CRUMB01 CRUMB02 CRUMB02 ...

What should happen if there are too many crumbs to display? The first thing
that could be done to reclaim space (even before you run out of space) is to
shorten the view-type button. 

File System, which displays as &quot;[icon] Filesystem&quot; could collapse to &quot;[icon]&quot;
as soon as the crumb trail grows beyond the root directory. Users should be
able to jump to the top of the file system without having to scroll to find it
(this replaces the legacy &quot;/&quot;). Tuukkah's implementation works like this now,
except for the collapsing crumb. 

So
	VIEWS FS_ICON+LABEL
becomes
	VIEWS FS_ICON CRUMB

The great benefit of breadcrumbs is that it saves mouse-clicks. If it causes
you to use more clicks, then it's lost its efficiency. Unlike the gtk
implementation that knocks previous crumbs out of view to display long crumbs,
you should always be able to move up to the parent crumb with only one click.
That means that the previous crumb should always be visible, instead of
forcing you to scroll to make it visible, and then click it. If there's not
enough space to display the name of the parent crumb, then it should display
as an icon. (Probably a file folder would be appropriate, since an up arrow,
while perfectly sensible for moving up a directory tree structure, doesn't
make as much sense if your crumb trail moves horizontally.)

Like so:
	VIEWS FS_ICON ^ CURRENT_CRUMB

^ == iconized parent crumb button

If the current crumb is too long to display fully, the title should truncate
with ... at the edge of the screen, the way long entries do in the Library
album view.

Like so:
	VIEWS FS_ICON CURRENT_CRU...

When there are enough crumbs to require scrolling the trail, a LEFT arrow
should be placed after the FILESYSTEM crumb. (There's no reason to eat up
space by adding a RIGHT arrow unless it's needed to move that way. Sonata has
never supported moving forward, only back. It might be nice to be able to move
forward.)

	VIEWS FS_ICON &lt; ^ CURRENT_CRUMB
or:
	VIEWS FS_ICON &lt; ^ CURRENT_CRU...

and possibly:
	VIEWS FS_ICON &lt; ^ CURRENT_CRU... &gt;

&lt; = left arrow
&gt;<i> = right arrow
</I>^ = parent crumb

It would be super-cool if the trail could be rolled with the mousewheel.
Nautilus allows this; I don't recall if Thunar does or not.

So are my ideas for better breadcrumbing. Any thoughts?

 michael
