<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to be the age old story, help those that are well versed, but
</I>&gt;<i> havent got time for those that really need help. The Ubuntu forums pat
</I>&gt;<i> answer is, use Google. Some of us dont understand unless we are shown. Linux
</I>&gt;<i> will never get anywhere unless attitudes change. I am fully aware that
</I>&gt;<i> people have lives, I also have one, but I also want to learn, and Linux is
</I>&gt;<i> an option I chose because I dont like MS, but at least there, there are
</I>&gt;<i> options to get help. Its quite sad really.
</I>
I think you have to accept the fact, that other members of any
linux-related community will expect you to spent some time on your
own, figuring out how to do stuff. Every one of us did it at some
point, and it's the best way to learn. Asking questions on the
group/forum is, at least for me, the last resort, and I'm using it
only if I failed after I've *really* went through all the google
search,  tutorials, all the manual pages and spent days trying to do
it on my own.
You have to read, read, and one more time read. And do a lot of
try/fail excercises.

And, one more thing, do not expect anyone to help you. This is only
anyone's good will to spent his/her time helping you. And don't be
suprised, that dev's or some other experienced users are more willing
to spent their time on solving non-trivial dillemas.

Good luck with your problem, sorry couldn't help
Kamil
