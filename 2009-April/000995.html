To begin with, I should point out that if the sidebar is resizable, 
those who are happy with the current situation can resize the new 
sidebar to zero once and stay happy after :-)

Yes, this is important because people need feedback to confirm their 
actions.

&gt;<i> We don't have a one-click way to clear the playlist now. Has this been a problem?
</I>
This discussion started from the usability testing that Tom&#225;&#353; had 
conducted. One issue raised was the add/replace distinction. When you 
need replace, you're in the Library tab and it has to be clear what to 
do. I think the Current sidebar and (possibly) a Clear button in it 
could be a great way to address this.

&gt;&gt;<i> DnD would enable &quot;clickless&quot; adds and reordering while adding, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the other hand, it would be slower than the double-clicks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's true, but presumably DnD would augment and not replace double-clicking,
</I>&gt;<i> right?
</I>
Right. I guess my point here was that DnD alone is not enough to address 
the issue although it has its advantages.


&gt;&gt;<i> I see Sonata isn't the only music player with this design problem. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Has anyone seen a nice design in some of the other apps out there? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The xplorer2 file manager uses an interesting model that might give us some
</I>&gt;<i> ideas. It's a two pane file manager, and you can open directories in tabs in
</I>&gt;<i> both panes. The nice thing about the functionality is that unlike the new
</I>&gt;<i> Nautilus implementation of tabbed file management, you can DnD files onto a
</I>&gt;<i> tab. (Nautilus simply switches to the tab and forces you to drop your files in
</I>&gt;<i> the directory window.)
</I>
Interesting indeed. The plus is that DnD provides feedback. However, the 
minus is that DnD is slow compared to the fact that in Sonata, you can 
achieve the same with a simple double click.

&gt;<i> If it was possible to set a &quot;marker&quot; in the Current list, then the DnD on the
</I>&gt;<i> Current tab could drop the files at that location. (ALT-click might be a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea, since it's not used; and it should probably set a different color
</I>&gt;<i> highlight than normal left-clicks.) And if there's no marker, the add is just
</I>&gt;<i> to the bottom of the list.
</I>
This applies as much to the current double-click adds (as you pointed 
out below). A simpler variation might be to make the marker an 
always-present entry in the Current list, and you could move it via DnD 
and whatever tools we have for playlist reordering.
