EDIT: removed screenshot and resubmitted since the list server held the
original for moderator approval. Sorry about that... (I think it's still clear
what I'm talking about.)

I took a quick look at the new breadcrumbs feature, and I have to say that on
my system, it looks pretty bad.

I run Sonata fairly narrow. Only slightly narrower than all of the screenshots
on the Sonata website. One of the greatest things about Sonata is that it's so
compact that it actually encourages this. It's not a huge music manager that
requires you to devote a massive amount of screen real estate just to be able
to see all the parts of the UI at once.

As you can see in the attached screenshot [EDIT: removed], the breadcrumbs
implementation takes up so much horizontal width that the final directory is
cut off. I have some directories where the parents are so long that the
children don't even appear in the UI.

It's also important to mention that my mpd library root directory is a small
subset of my collection -- on that I've cleaned up and correctly tagged. If I
was to point mpd to the actual root of my library (which I'll eventually have
to do when everything is cleaned up), I'd have to run Sonata close to full
screen to be able to see the current directory.

I do like that that the view is part of the breadcrumb, though I'm not sure if
&quot;Filesystem&quot; is intuitive enough to make someone assume that it's the root
directory. After all, in Sonata context, file system is a view, not a place.
Now it's both a view AND a place.

I don't know if there's a way of fixing this issue, if you want to stick with
a breadcrumbs-only display. While this implementation obviously needs some
refinement, I think it would be better to offer users the flexibility of
choosing the navigation UI that suits their way of doing things. Even the
Nautilus UI does this.
