I'm not a coder, but I've done a fair amount of UI design over the years, so
I'm going to take a stab at this from a couple of perspectives...

Sonata, in its current form, makes very efficient use of its vertical space.
There are individual rows for controls, information, tabs, and navigation --
and most of them are fully populated all the way across (if you run a narrow
window). The nav row, though in a state of flux, is mostly blank if you're on
any view except File System. Devoting another row entirely to the Library
tab/button, even if it springs into a panel, would impact the efficiency of
the layout.

My kneejerk reaction is that if -- and only if -- it's important to be able to
run Sonata in a compact fashion, then some effort should be made to keep the
UI as a non-split single window. Small is great for a single window, but makes
two worthless halves if it's split, because neither half gives you enough real
estate to be all that functional or convenient. Requiring users to resize the
main window to make a new element useful doesn't seem like a good idea,
either. Tear-off, or separate windows are good, because assumably you'd open
one, do whatever you were going to do, and then close it once you're done.

Sonata's great strength lies in the fact that it has an inherently small
desktop footprint. This sets it apart from almost all other media players,
since the trend has been to integrate much more management, organizing, and
cataloging functionality, all of which require screen space to present all the
data legibly.

If anything, my thinking is geared towards finding a less complex solution. I
probably spend &lt;2% of my Sonata use time loading things to listen to; the
other &gt;98%, it just sits there playing and making me happy -- so I need the
functionality, but I don't require it to be a major component of the UI. YMMV.

Here's a question: can tabs also be buttons? If so, middle-clicking a tab
could open it in a separate window, which means people could drag things
between windows, then close the child window. It would be even cooler if that
click could act as a show/hide toggle; you wouldn't need window decoration,
and your mousing could be more efficient since you control it from the main
window, which is where you control all the other parts of Sonata.

Thoughts?
