<PRE>Tuukka,
I was thinking about You idea of two panels in Sonata.  I have to say
that I like very much Sonata's clean one panel interface, but I was
imagining, that it could work like a Firefox sidebar. Was that what
You had in mind? Something like that normally the active playlist
would be visible. Cliking a Library tab would devide the panel in two
with library on the right (the division would be movable - like quasi
all GTK apps have - after reading last Michael's post saying that he
runs Sonata very narrow, it would be nice to remember the division
made last time, so it would not always default to 50/50. This way one
could entirely hide the Active playlist when searchnig the library,
and use Sonata narrow, the same way as now). One could search the
library and drag the files to current playlist. Clicking Playlists
would replace the Library panel with the Playlist one, and so on with
Song info tab. Clicking Active playlist or little cross on top of the
side panel (like Firefox sidebar has) would get back to one panel view
with Active playlist.

Was it something like this You had in mind?

Tomas
