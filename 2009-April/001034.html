John: If you'd like, I wouldn't mind giving a shot helping you through this difficulty. Although if you're happy with a simple music player that's easier to get going, there are some, like maybe Exaile, or muine.

Subject: Re: [Sonata-users] Installing Sonata....








Hi, I'm not asking for Ubuntu related questions I'm asking for Sonata
based questions, about how to install the program. As for being on the
Ubuntu site, I have seen quite a few people asking the same questions
as myself, with the difficulty of installing and configuring. Also, the
fact that its not easy asking you questions, as per usual, you only
have time for people who are converse with Linux. (by you I mean the
group) 



I see quite a few posts on the Ubuntu section, that havent even been
answered to with this program, which is why I found this group, to see
if it might help. 



I am being put off to be honest, because I have to admit, its like
pulling blood from a stone to get an answer. You are aware of my level
of understanding, and still you havent really answered my questions
regarding installation, but you have done a very good job of answering
everything else. It seems to be the age old story, help those that are
well versed, but havent got time for those that really need help. The
Ubuntu forums pat answer is, use Google. Some of us dont understand
unless we are shown. Linux will never get anywhere unless attitudes
change. I am fully aware that people have lives, I also have one, but I
also want to learn, and Linux is an option I chose because I dont like
MS, but at least there, there are options to get help. Its quite sad
really.



I wont bother you again, I think I have all I need to know about this
program. I have been put off by attitude. 



Thanks for all you help. 



John.

    Can I ask a question, how can you say that this is not to do with 
Sonata, when Sonata wont work without it. 
    
  
  I wish setting up Sonata was a breeze, but as it is, Sonata depends on 
MPD, which depends on editing a text file, which is a basic computer skill.

  
  
    Surely, as the two come 
together, they are part of each other, so it is a part of Sonata, 
because of that reason. 
    
  
  Everything more or less comes together in the computer world. However, 
the best place to ask for support depends on various aspects:

* The best people to help in issues specific to Ubuntu are the Ubuntu 
people.

* The best people to explain basic computer/Linux/Gnome/Ubuntu skills 
are people who've learned them recently themselves and can empathise.

* Sonata is not useful without MPD, so we want people to get their MPD 
problems solved :-)

Installing packages is specific to Ubuntu, as is the exact version and 
configuration of Gnome etc. ubuntuforums.org is a particularly 
beginner-welcoming community for asking your questions.

  
  
    I am sorry that I have taken up your time, it 
isnt an easy installation, even for Ubuntu it isnt easy. Its not very 
well documented.
    
  
  I know the MPD part is not as easy as it could be, and I'm interested in 
the experiences people have with it. The question is what we could have 
documented better. (A hopefully helpful hint I read somewhere: if you 
start your question by stating which documentation you've consulted and 
how it fell short, you're more likely to get an answer.)

  
  
    There are many people on the Ubuntu forums with the 
same problem that I have had, which kind of shows that its not an easy 
thing to get your head around.
    
  
  I don't think it's the same problem, on the level other than &quot;Can't get 
MPD to work.&quot;

  
  
    Its only because I want to learn that I have actually stuck with it.
    
  
  That's a good attitude. That's why I pointed to help.ubuntu.com, there's 
one good place to start learning about Ubuntu.

  
  
    I 
find it really sad that I have had to push so hard, to get answers, and 
so little understanding of my situation. 
    
  
  In non-commercial communities, you get things out of it without paying, 
but you need to consider the social aspects: How much free time do 
people have to work on this? How do they best spend their time in their, 
the community's, and your interest? What motivates them?

In general, I'd say you didn't have to push hard, you should be happy 
you got answers and you should realise that the longer the answer, the 
more the writer sympathised.

  
  
    It doesnt bode well for a program.
    
  
  We could just say it's not for people like you yet and work on it. 
However, I'm interested in feedback.


Hoping this helps,
Tuukka
