In fact, if you're using the filesystem view, I'd wager that you might never use any of the other views. That combined with us removing the &quot;..&quot; and &quot;/&quot; list items (I would really like to see Sonata use the breadcrumbs approach that Tuukka has been working on) makes the larger size icons much less compelling. So I just reverted the behavior for the Filesystem view, they now use the smaller size.

Since you mentioned them, Scott, I have a couple of questions about the icons and views...

The file system icons are scaled down to the perfect size for a single line of text. The artists and genres icons seem to be the same size, and they match the text that accompanies them. However, the albums icons -- which contain the same two rows of text as artists and genres -- are immense. (Or at least they seem to be.) Shouldn't they really be the same size as the other&#160; two, if only for consistency?

In doing a lot of playing with the different views and what each offer (I usually use FS view, but albums is useful, too), I was wondering if it would be possible to have the path to where you are in a view be preserved if you change view to a different appropriate type? In other words, if you're in album view, and you're looking at the contents of an album and you switch to FS view, it would be nice to have the view stay in that directory, instead of switching to the root of the FS. I don't suppose this matters as much if you're in FS view and you switch to album, but it would still be a nice touch if the cursor selector followed your position.
