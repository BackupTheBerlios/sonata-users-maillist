<PRE>dear sonata team,

i've been looking for some software that is usable as a mpd-client on a 
system that has a screen and is controlled via remote for quite a long 
time - all of theese &quot;media-center&quot; softwares don't have a mpd interface 
(don't know why as mpd is really nice for something you put next to your 
stereo as it has many different interfaces you can use - as beeing able 
to use your mobile phone or a notebook when sitting somewhere else in a 
room than in front of the tv...).

anyway - i'm very happy with sonata as it has many keyboard shortcuts i 
could map to the remote keys and the interface is very simple. still 
there is some minor things that would make it even better for using it 
that way:

one thing would make it more usable via remote:

- a key mapping that moves the current selection up or down in the
   playlist

one thing that would make other gnome apps more usable:

- a possibility to set the ui-font seperately from the default gnome
   font (as then i dont have to make the default system sonst that large
   to be able to read the texts from far away...)

and there is some minor graphical things:

- the cover-art in the library is not scaled with the font - so it gets
   quite small when used like i do with font sizes around 30

- the full-screen mode would be nicer if the cover-art would get
   scaled and there would be some kind progress bar. also the fonts seems
   not to get scaled by the default font so it's hardly readable in my
   setup.

- it would be nice if the artists list would use the picture of the
   first album as icon instead of using just a stadard icon for all
   artists.


thanks for the good work - i really enjoy using sonata!

best regards
roman
