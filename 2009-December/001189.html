<PRE>Hello,

Sonata was the last application which used the egg.trayicon module on my
computer, so I decided to take a look to see if I could remove the
dependency on this module, as this functionality is provided by
gtk.StatusIcon.

At first glance, it looks like Sonata already supported StatusIcon, but
not as well as egg.trayicon, in particular:

  * middle click on the tray icon didn't toggle play/pause
  * scrolling with the middle button didn't raise or lower the volume

Looking in the code show that the support of both module is rather hard
to follow: there are a bunch of ifs all around the code, methods and
attributes which exist only to provide support for one or the other
module, dispatched in different places...


So, I decided to get my hands dirty, and I extracted all of this into
dedicated classes, with the same interface. Now, Sonata only has one
tray object, which wraps call to either egg.trayicon or gtk.StatusIcon.

I also updated the support of gtk.StatusIcon so that it offers the same
level of functionalities as egg.trayicon (at least for the two problems I
raised below).


Currently, the code works fine for me, with either gtk.StatusIcon or
egg.trayicon, with only one remaining glitch: the &quot;Enable system tray
icon&quot; can always be enabled or disable, whereas the underlying
platform support it or not.

Anyway, I decided to publish this, so that I can get feedback and
potentially some help too. The patch is available in a TopGit branch
'refactor-tray-icon' on <A HREF="http://github.com/multani/sonata-tray-icon">http://github.com/multani/sonata-tray-icon</A>
Eventually, I hope this patch to be integrated into the main repository
when it will get ready.

Any comments are welcome!


Regards,

 Jonathan
